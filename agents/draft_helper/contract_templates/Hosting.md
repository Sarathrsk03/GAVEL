For servers, only the servers identified as {{party_name}} in Exhibit A are considered an {{party_name}} Managed Device. “{{effective_date}} Availability Percentage” means the amount equal to the total number of minutes in the applicable {{effective_date}} minus {{party_name}} for {{effective_date}}, divided by the total number of minutes in {{effective_date}}. “{{effective_date}} Recurring Charge” means the total of {{party_name}}’s {{effective_date}} recurring charges. “{{party_name}}” means the period (measured in whole minutes) from the time indicated in a trouble ticket (when the {{party_name}} was reported to {{party_name}}) to the {{party_name}} end time based upon the problem resolution (as reflected in the trouble ticket call record). For clustered devices, all of the devices in the cluster must not be available for use by {{party_name}}. “Qualifying {{party_name}}” means the {{party_name}} Managed {{party_name}} that has been selected by {{party_name}} and approved by {{party_name}}. “Qualifying {{party_name}} Minutes” means the aggregate of all {{party_name}}s in a {{effective_date}}, minus any {{party_name}}s in {{effective_date}} resulting from any exclusion described in Section {{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}} below. “{{party_name}} Target Percentage” means the Service Levels defined in {{effective_date}}.2 (Service Levels). “Unqualified {{party_name}}(s)” means an {{party_name}}(s) that can be attributed to the listed availability exclusions as set forth in Section {{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}} (Exclusions). Page 24 of 3{{effective_date}} Service Levels Source: {{party_name}}, {{effective_date}}-K, {{effective_date}} Service Levels {{party_name}} will provide the following {{effective_date}} availability Service Level {{party_name}} (“{{party_name}}”) for the {{party_name}} provided by {{party_name}}: For {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} (including firewall(s) and switches) that are not clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the {{party_name}} is a minimum of {{effective_date}}{{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}} percent. For {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} (including firewall(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the {{party_name}} is a minimum of {{effective_date}}{{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}} percent. For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the {{party_name}} is a minimum of {{effective_date}}{{effective_date}}.0 percent. For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that is not clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the {{party_name}} is a minimum of {{effective_date}}{{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}} percent. For Basic Monitoring {{party_name}} the {{party_name}} is a minimum of {{effective_date}}{{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}} percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, {{party_name}} acceleration, {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} segments, switches, VPN connection at the {{party_name}}, and all related connections). For Advanced Monitoring {{party_name}} the {{party_name}} is a minimum of {{effective_date}}{{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}} percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, {{party_name}} acceleration, {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} segments, switches, VPN connection at the {{party_name}}, and all related connections). Availability Credits If in any {{effective_date}} during the term of Managed Hosting {{party_name}} {{party_name}} for a Qualifying {{party_name}} is less than the {{party_name}} Target Percentage for that Qualifying {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall be eligible to receive {{party_name}}, subject to Section {{effective_date}}.3(b), {{effective_date}}.4, {{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}}, {{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}} and {{effective_date}}.{{effective_date}}.
