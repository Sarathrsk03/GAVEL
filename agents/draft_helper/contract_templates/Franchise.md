In this {{party_name}}, “{{party_name}}” as a verb means to sell, assign, give away, pledge, or encumber, either voluntarily or by operation of law (such as through divorce or bankruptcy proceedings), any interest in this {{party_name}} the rights and/or obligations under this {{party_name}}, all or substantially all of the assets of {{party_name}}, and/or any direct or indirect interest in the ownership of {{party_name}} (if the {{party_name}} is a corporation, partnership, or limited liability company). “{{party_name}}” as a noun means any such sale, assignment, etc. 14.2. No {{party_name}} without Our Prior Written Consent. Neither you nor any of the {{party_name}} may make any {{party_name}} or permit any {{party_name}} to occur without obtaining our prior written consent. We have the right to withhold our consent, except as otherwise provided in {{party_name}} 14.3 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business] through 14.8 [Our Right of First Refusal]. We have the right to communicate with and counsel both you and the proposed transferee on any aspect of a proposed {{party_name}}. If a {{party_name}} requires our consent, then that transaction may not take place until at least sixty ({{effective_date}} after we receive written notice of the proposed {{party_name}}. You agree to provide any information and documentation relating to the proposed {{party_name}} that we reasonably require. Unless otherwise agreed, we do not waive any claims against the transferring party if we approve the {{party_name}}. 14.3. {{party_name}} of Entire Business. For a proposed {{party_name}} of {{party_name}} or this {{party_name}} (or, if {{party_name}} is a corporation or other entity, a {{party_name}} of ownership interests that would result in a change of control of {{party_name}}), the following conditions apply (unless waived by us): 14.3.1. You must be in compliance with all obligations to us under this {{party_name}} and any other agreement you have with us and our affiliates as of the date of the request for our approval of the {{party_name}}, or you must make arrangements satisfactory to us to come into compliance by the date of the {{party_name}}. 14.3.2. The proposed transferee must complete all of the following requirements: (a) Demonstrate to our satisfaction that he or she meets all of our then-current qualifications to become a {{party_name}} franchisee, and, at our request, the proposed transferee must travel (at his or her expense) to our principal office for an interview. (b) Sign our then-current standard form of franchise agreement (or the standard form most recently offered to new franchisees, if we are not then offering franchises to new franchisees) for the then-remaining balance of {{party_name}}, and such other ancillary agreements we require for new {{party_name}}. Their new franchise agreement may materially differ from the terms of this {{party_name}}. (c) Successfully complete our then-current training requirements and pay the then-current fee for training. (d) If the proposed transferee is one of our other franchisees, he or she must not be in default under his or her agreements with us and must have a good record of customer service and compliance with our operating standards. (e) If the transferee is a corporation or other entity, the owner or owners of a beneficial interest in the transferee must execute our then-current form of personal guarantee. Page 27 of 39 Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 14.3.3. You or the transferee must make arrangements to modernize, upgrade, and conform {{party_name}}, at your and/or the transferee’s expense, to our then-current standards and specifications for new {{party_name}}. 14.3.4. We must be paid, either by you or the transferee, a transfer fee (“{{party_name}} Fee”) in an amount equal to ${{amount}} (or {{amount}} ({{amount}}) of the then-current initial franchise fee, if greater). The payment of this transfer fee is in place of any initial franchise fee due under the Franchise {{party_name}} the transferee will enter under Section 14.3.2 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business] above. If the transferee is a spouse, son, or daughter of the transferor and the transfer is for estate-planning purposes, no transfer fee is charged, but the transferor must reimburse us for the out-of-pocket expenses (including attorneys’ fees) we incur in connection with reviewing, approving, and properly documenting the transfer. 14.3.5. You and all {{party_name}} must execute a general release, in a form satisfactory to us, of all claims against us and our past, present and future affiliates, officers, directors, shareholders, agents and employees. You and the {{party_name}} will remain liable to us for all obligations arising before the effective date of the {{party_name}}. 14.3.6. The price and other proposed terms of the {{party_name}} must not, in our reasonable business judgment, have the effect of negatively impacting the future viability of {{party_name}}. 14.4. {{party_name}} of a Partial {{party_name}}hip Interest. For any proposal to admit a new {{party_name}}, to remove an existing {{party_name}}, or to change the distribution of ownership shown on the cover page, or for any other transaction that amounts to the {{party_name}} of a partial interest in {{party_name}}, you must give us advance notice and submit a copy of all proposed contracts and other information concerning the {{party_name}} that we may request. We will have the right to require reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses that we incur in reviewing the proposed {{party_name}}. We will have a reasonable time (not less than thirty ({{effective_date}}) after we have received all requested information to evaluate the proposed {{party_name}}. You must satisfy the conditions in {{party_name}} 8.6, 14.3.2(a) [{{party_name}} of Entire Business], 14.3.4 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business], 14.3.5 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business], and 14.3.6 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business] above in connection with any such transfer. We may withhold our consent on any reasonable grounds or give our consent subject to reasonable conditions. You acknowledge that any proposed new owner must submit a personal application and execute a personal guarantee in the same form signed by the original {{party_name}}. {{effective_date}}. {{party_name}} to a Corporation or Other Entity. We will consent to the assignment of this {{party_name}} to a corporation, partnership or limited liability corporation that you form for the convenience of ownership, provided that: (a) the entity has and will have no other business besides operating a Franchised Business (b) you satisfy the conditions in {{party_name}} 14.3.2(a) [{{party_name}} of Entire Business], 14.3.3 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business], 14.3.4 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business] and 14.3.5 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business] above; and (c) the {{party_name}} hold equity interests in the new entity in the same proportion shown on the cover page. There is no {{party_name}} Fee for a {{party_name}} to a corporation for convenience of ownership. 14.6. {{party_name}} upon Death or Incapacity. If you or any {{party_name}} dies, becomes incapacitated, or enters bankruptcy proceedings, that person’s executor, administrator, personal representative, or trustee must apply to us in writing within three ({{effective_date}} after the event (death, declaration of incapacity, or filing of a bankruptcy petition) for consent to {{party_name}} the person’s interest. The {{party_name}} will be subject to the provisions of {{party_name}} 14.2 [No {{party_name}} without Our Prior Written Consent] through 14.8 [Our Right of First Refusal], as applicable, except there will be no {{party_name}} Fee. In addition, if the deceased or incapacitated person is {{party_name}}, you must within {{effective_date}} thereafter, hire and retain a replacement, who is satisfactory to us, to perform such obligations. If a satisfactory replacement is not retained, we will have the right (but not the obligation) to take over operation of {{party_name}}, or to hire and retain a replacement on your behalf, until the {{party_name}} is completed and to charge a reasonable management fee for these services. For purposes of this Section, “incapacity” means any physical or mental infirmity that will prevent the person from performing his or her obligations under this {{party_name}}: (i) for a period of thirty (30) or more consecutive {{effective_date}}; or (ii) for sixty (60) or more total {{effective_date}} during {{effective_date}}. In the case of {{party_name}} by bequest or by intestate succession, if the heirs or beneficiaries are unable to meet the conditions of Section 14.3 [{{party_name}} of Entire Business], the executor may transfer the decedent’s interest to another successor that we have approved, subject to all of the terms and conditions for {{party_name}}s contained in this {{party_name}}. If an interest is not disposed of under this Section 14.6 [{{party_name}} upon Death or Incapacity] within six ({{effective_date}} after the date of death or appointment of a personal representative or trustee, we may terminate this {{party_name}} under Section 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] below. Page 28 of 39 Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 14.7. Non-Conforming {{party_name}}s. Any purported {{party_name}} that is not in compliance with this Section 14 is null and void and constitutes a material breach of this {{party_name}}, for which we may terminate this {{party_name}} without opportunity to cure. Our consent to a {{party_name}} does not constitute a waiver of any claims that we have against the transferor, nor is it a waiver of our right to demand exact compliance with the terms of this {{party_name}}. 14.8. Our Right of First Refusal. We have the right, exercisable within thirty ({{effective_date}} after receipt of the notice specified in Section 14.2 [No {{party_name}} without Our Prior Written Consent], to send written notice to you that we intend to purchase the interest proposed to be {{party_name}}red. We may assign our right of first refusal to someone else either before or after we exercise it. However, our right of first refusal will not apply with regard to a {{party_name}} under Section {{effective_date}} [{{party_name}} to a Corporation or Other Entity] or a {{party_name}} to your parents, spouse, son, daughter, or mother or father in-law (including {{party_name}}s to your parents, spouse, son, daughter, or mother or father in-law as a result of death or incapacity as described in Section 14.6 [{{party_name}} upon Death or Incapacity]). 14.8.1. If the {{party_name}} is proposed to be made pursuant to a sale, we or our designee may purchase the interest proposed to be {{party_name}}red on the same economic terms and conditions offered by the third-party. Closing on our purchase must occur by the later of (a) {{effective_date}} after the date of our notice to the seller electing to purchase the interest, or (b) the closing date as proposed in the third-party’s purchase offer. If we cannot reasonably be expected to furnish the same consideration as the third-party, then we may substitute the reasonable equivalent in cash. If the parties cannot agree within {{effective_date}} on the reasonable equivalent in cash, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser and the appraiser’s determination will be final. Any material change in the terms of the offer from a third-party after we have elected not to purchase the seller’s interest will constitute a new offer subject to the same right of first refusal as the third party’s initial offer. 14.8.2. If a {{party_name}} is proposed to be made by gift, we will designate, at our expense, an independent appraiser to determine the fair market value of the interest proposed to be transferred. We may purchase the interest at the fair market value determined by the appraiser. Closing on the purchase will occur within {{effective_date}} after our notice to the transferor of the appraiser’s determination of fair market value. 14.8.3. If we elect not to exercise our rights under this Section, the transferor may complete the {{party_name}} after complying with {{party_name}} 14.2 [No {{party_name}} without Our Prior Written Consent] through 14.6 [{{party_name}} upon Death or Incapacity] above. Closing of the {{party_name}} must occur within {{effective_date}} of our election (or such longer period as applicable law may require); otherwise, the third-party’s offer will be treated as a new offer subject to our right of first refusal. The {{party_name}} is conditional upon our determination that the {{party_name}} was on terms substantially the same as those offered to us. 15. TERMINATION 15.1. Termination By Us Without Notice. You will be in default under this {{party_name}} and all rights granted by this {{party_name}} will automatically terminate without notice to you if you become insolvent or make an assignment for the benefit of your creditors; if a receiver is appointed; if execution is levied against your business assets; or if suit to foreclose any lien or mortgage or bankruptcy is instituted against you and not dismissed within {{effective_date}}. Page 29 of 39 Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 15.2. Termination By Us Without A Cure Period. We may terminate this {{party_name}} by written notice to you, without giving you an opportunity to cure, upon the occurrence of any of the following events: 15.2.1.

You refuse to permit, or try to hinder, an examination or audit of your books and records or of {{party_name}} as provided in this {{party_name}}. 15.2.5.

You understate to us your Gross Revenues, by {{amount}} or more on three or more occasions in any {{effective_date}} period, or by {{amount}} or more for any period of four or {{effective_date}}. 15.2.7. You fail to operate {{party_name}} for three or {{effective_date}} on which you were required to operate, unless we determine that the failure was beyond your control. 15.2.8. You or any {{party_name}}, officer or director is convicted of a crime that we reasonably believe is likely to harm the reputation of the {{party_name}} concept. 15.2.9. Any {{party_name}} occurs that does not comply with Section 14, including a failure to transfer to a qualified successor after death or disability within the time allowed by Section 14.7 [Non-Conforming {{party_name}}s]. 15.2.10. You are in default three (3) or more times under {{party_name}} 15.3 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for {{party_name}}] and/or 15.4 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period] within any twelve ({{effective_date}}, whether or not the defaults are similar and whether or not they are cured. 15.2.11. After curing a default pursuant to {{party_name}} 15.3 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for {{party_name}}] or 15.4 [Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period], you commit the same default within twelve ({{effective_date}}, whether or not the second default is cured. 15.2.12. Any condition exists with respect to {{party_name}} that, in our reasonable judgment, seriously jeopardizes public health or safety. 15.2.13.

You fail to obtain or maintain required insurance. 15.2.15. You cease to operate {{party_name}} for more than seven (7) consecutive {{effective_date}} or {{effective_date}} (14) {{effective_date}} in any calendar year unless we approved a temporary closing or we determine, that the failure to operate was beyond your control, you otherwise abandon {{party_name}}, or you lose the right to possess the Premises or you otherwise forfeit the right to do or transact business as required under this {{party_name}}. If, however, through no fault of you, the Premises are damaged or destroyed by an event such that repairs or reconstruction cannot be completed within ninety (90) {{effective_date}} thereafter, you will have thirty ({{effective_date}} after such event in which to apply for our approval to relocate and/or reconstruct the premises, and we will not unreasonably hold our approval. Page 30 of 39 Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 15.3. Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period for {{party_name}}. You will be in default under this {{party_name}} if you fail, refuse, or neglect to pay when due (including if we are not able to collect payments by electronic fund transfer pursuant to Section 3.6 [Method of Payment] due to insufficient funds in your account(s), closure of your account(s), or any other reason resulting in the nonpayment) any monies owing to us, our affiliates, or any lender that has provided financing to you under this {{party_name}} or any other agreement, or to your landlord and/or any supplier of goods or services to your Franchised Business. You will have ten (10) {{effective_date}} after written notice of such default from us within which to remedy the default. You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the {{effective_date}} period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within such {{effective_date}} period (or such longer period as applicable law may require), this {{party_name}} will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period. 15.4 Termination by Us Following Expiration of Cure Period. For any default not covered under {{party_name}} 15.1 [Termination By Us Without Notice], 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period], or 15.3 above, you will have thirty ({{effective_date}} after written notice of default from us within which to remedy the default. You may avoid termination by curing the default to our satisfaction within the {{effective_date}} period (or such longer period as applicable law may require). If you do not cure the default within the specified time, this {{party_name}} will terminate automatically and without further notice, effective immediately upon the expiration of the specified time period. Any failure to comply with this {{party_name}}, as amended or reasonably supplemented by the Manual or otherwise in writing, not covered by {{party_name}} 15.1 [Termination By Us Without Notice], 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period], or 15.3 above constitutes a default, including, but not limited to, the following: 15.3.1. You fail, refuse, or neglect to submit to us the financial and other reports and information required under this {{party_name}}. 15.3.2. You fail to comply with any of the mandatory standards or procedures prescribed by us in this {{party_name}}, the Manual, or otherwise in writing. 15.3.3. You fail, refuse, or neglect to obtain our prior written approval or consent as required by this {{party_name}} (other than a failure to obtain consent to a proposed {{party_name}}, for which we may terminate without a cure period as provided in Section 15.2 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period]). 15.3.4. For a period of fifteen (15) {{effective_date}}, you allow a continued violation of any law, ordinance, rule or regulation of a governmental agency, including the failure to maintain or procure any required licenses, permits, or certifications, in the absence of a good faith dispute over its application or legality and without promptly resorting to an appropriate administrative or judicial forum for relief. 15.3.5. You misuse or make any unauthorized use of {{party_name}} or otherwise materially impair our goodwill or rights in {{party_name}}. 15.5. {{party_name}}. Any default by you (including for this purpose your affiliates) under any other agreement with us will constitute a default under this {{party_name}}, subject to the same provisions for notice and cure, if any, as may be applicable to the default under the other agreement. 16. OBLIGATIONS ON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION 16.1. Upon termination or expiration of this {{party_name}} for any reason, unless we direct you otherwise: 16.1.1. You agree to promptly pay all sums owing to us, our affiliates and suppliers, including, but not limited to, {{party_name}} payments, contributions to {{party_name}}, or other fees, damages, expenses, and attorney’s fees incurred as a result of your default. Page 31 of 39 Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 16.1.2. You agree to stop making any use of the confidential methods, procedures, and techniques associated with the {{party_name}}. You also agree to immediately deliver to us the Manual and all training materials, marketing materials, records, files, forms, instructions, signs, equipment, correspondence, copies, {{party_name}}, and other property in your possession or control that contain confidential information (as defined in Section 12) or that bear {{party_name}} and you agree not to retain any unauthorized copies of these materials. You also must deliver to us all customer information that you have compiled. 16.1.3. You agree to immediately cease to use, by advertising or in any other manner, the name “{{party_name}},” all other Proprietary Marks, and all other distinctive forms, slogans, signs, symbols, {{party_name}}s, domain name, website, e-mail address, and any other identifier (whether or not we have authorized its use) that you used in connection with your operation of {{party_name}} or that are otherwise associated with {{party_name}}, {{party_name}}, and/or us. If you subsequently begin to operate another business, you agree that you will not use any reproduction, counterfeit, copy or colorable imitation of {{party_name}} that you used either in connection with {{party_name}} or its promotion, which is likely to cause confusion, mistake or deception, or which is likely to dilute our exclusive rights in and to {{party_name}}, nor any trade dress or designation of origin or description or representation which falsely suggests or represents an association or connection with us. 16.1.4. You agree to promptly take such action as may be necessary to cancel any assumed name registration or equivalent registration containing the name PIZZA FUSION or any other Proprietary Marks. 16.1.5 You will, at our option, assign to us any interest which you have in the lease or sublease for the Premises. (a) If we do not elect or are unable to exercise our option to acquire, or to acquire the lease or sublease for the Premises, you must make such modifications or alterations to the premises operated hereunder (including, without limitation, the changing of the telephone number) immediately upon termination or expiration of this {{party_name}} as may be necessary to distinguish the appearance of the Premises from that of other {{party_name}}s under the {{party_name}}, and such specific additional changes as we may reasonably request for that purpose. In addition, you must stop making any use of any telephone number and/or any domain name, website, e-mail address, and any other identifier (whether or not we have authorized its use) that you used in connection with your operation of {{party_name}}, and you must promptly execute such documents or take such steps necessary to remove reference to {{party_name}} from all trade or business telephone directories, including physical and online “yellow” and “white” pages, or at our request transfer same to us. (b) If you fail or refuse to comply with the requirements of this Section 16.1.5 [OBLIGATIONS ON TERMINATION OR EXPIRATION], we will have the right to enter upon the Premises, without being guilty of trespass or any other tort, for the purpose of making or causing to be made such changes as may be required, at your expense, which you agree to pay upon demand. 16.2. Purchase of Assets. You agree that, at our option, you will sell to us any or all your assets used to operate {{party_name}} (including equipment, fixtures, furnishings, {{party_name}}, supplies, and inventory) that we ask in writing to purchase. 16.2.1. The purchase price for such items will be equal to your depreciated cost (determined below) or fair market value, whichever is less. The cost will be determined based upon a five (5) year straight-line depreciation of original costs. For equipment that is five (5) or {{effective_date}}, the parties agree that fair market value will be deemed to be {{amount}} ({{amount}}) of the equipment’s original cost. The fair market value of tangible assets must be determined without reference to good will, going-concern value, or other intangible assets. Page 32 of 39 Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 16.2.2. We may exercise this option by delivering a notice of intent to purchase to you within {{effective_date}} after the expiration or termination of this {{party_name}}. During that {{effective_date}} period, you agree not to dispose of, transfer, or otherwise hinder our ability to exercise our rights with respect to your assets. 16.2.3. If we exercise our option to purchase, we may setoff all amounts due to us under this {{party_name}} and the cost of the appraisal (if any), against any payment due to you. 16.2.4. If we do not exercise our rights to purchase your Delivery Vehicle(s), you must immediately make such modifications or alterations to {{party_name}}) that may be needed to remove any Proprietary Marks and to otherwise distinguish the appearance of the vehicle(s) from those used by other {{party_name}}s. 16.3. Right to Enter and Continue Operations. In order to preserve the goodwill of the {{party_name}} following termination, we (or our designee) have the right to enter the Premises (without liability to you, your {{party_name}}, or otherwise) for the purpose continuing {{party_name}}’ operation and maintaining the goodwill of the business. 16.4. {{party_name}}. If this {{party_name}} is terminated due to your default, you must, upon written demand, pay us a lump-sum payment in an amount calculated as follows: (a) the average of your {{party_name}} fees and Advertising Contributions due for {{effective_date}} before our delivery of notice of default (or, if lesser, {{effective_date}} you had been operating before our delivery of notice of default), (b) multiplied by the lesser of 60 or the number of {{effective_date}} remaining in the term of this {{party_name}}. 16.5. {{party_name}}. 16.5.1 The payments called for in Section 16.4 [{{party_name}}] above constitute liquidated damages for causing the premature termination of this {{party_name}} and not a penalty. A precise calculation of the full extent of damages that we will incur if this {{party_name}} terminates because you default cannot be reasonably determined. Nevertheless, the parties agree that the lump-sum payment provided under Section 16.4 [{{party_name}}] above is reasonable in light of the damages for premature termination that may reasonably be expected to occur in such event. 16.5.2 The amounts contemplated under Section 16.4 [{{party_name}}] above is not a penalty and is intended by the parties only as a compensatory remedy for past breaches and not as a preventative remedy to deter future breaches. Neither does the sum contemplated in Section 16.4 [{{party_name}}] above represent a price for the privilege of not performing or its payment represent an alternative manner of performance. Accordingly, as a purely liquidated damage provision, this Section does not preclude, nor is inconsistent with, a court granting us specific performance or any other equitable remedies, such as an injunction, to prevent future breaches. Our rights to liquidated damages and specific performance or any other equitable relief are not mutually exclusive. 16.6. Enforcement Costs. You agree to pay all damages, costs, and expenses, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, that we incur (even if after the expiration or termination of this {{party_name}}) in enforcing this Section 16 or Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or {{party_name}}] below. 17. RESTRICTIONS ON COMPETITION 17.1. During Term. You acknowledge that this {{party_name}} will give you access to valuable and confidential information regarding the {{party_name}}, including our business development strategy and the operational, sales, promotional and marketing methods of {{party_name}}. You agree that during the term of this {{party_name}}, you will not, without our prior written consent, either directly or indirectly through any other person or entity: Page 33 of 39 Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 17.1.1. Own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, rent or lease to, or have any other interest in any business that (directly or indirectly) operates, or grants franchises or licenses to operate, a restaurant featuring pizza and related food specialties or that offers products or services substantially similar to those then offered by {{party_name}}s (“{{party_name}}”); 17.1.2. Divert or attempt to divert any business or customer, or potential business or customer, to any {{party_name}}; or 17.1.3. Induce any person to leave his or her employment with us. 17.1.4. In any manner interfere with, disturb, disrupt, impair, diminish, or otherwise jeopardize our business or that of any of our franchisees. 17.2. After Termination, Expiration, or {{party_name}}. For two ({{effective_date}} after the expiration or termination of this {{party_name}} or an approved {{party_name}} to a new franchisee, you may not directly or indirectly own, manage, engage in, be employed by, advise, make loans to, consult for, or have any other interest in any {{party_name}} that is, or intends to operate, within three (3) mile radius of {{party_name}} or within a three (3) mile radius of any {{party_name}} then-operating or under construction to operate under the {{party_name}}, except as permitted by any Franchise {{party_name}}s that remain in effect between you and us. . 17.3. {{party_name}} and Employees. The {{party_name}} agree that they will personally bind themselves to {{effective_date}} by signing this {{party_name}} or the attached Guaranty. With respect to the {{party_name}}, the time period in Section 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or {{party_name}}] will run from the expiration, termination, or {{party_name}} of this {{party_name}} or from the termination of the {{party_name}}’s relationship with you, whichever occurs first. You must also require and obtain execution of covenants similar to those set forth in Section 12 above, and {{effective_date}} (as modified to apply to an individual), from any or all of the following persons: your officers, directors, and their respective spouses and employees. (These persons and the {{party_name}} are each a “Restricted Party”) The covenants required by {{effective_date}}.3 [{{party_name}} and Employees] shall be in the form provided in Appendix C to this {{party_name}}. Failure by {{party_name}} to obtain execution of a covenant required by {{effective_date}}.3 [{{party_name}} and Employees] shall constitute a default under Section 15.2.13 [Termination By Us Without A Cure Period] above. 17.4. Indirect Violations Prohibited. You may not attempt to circumvent the restrictions in {{party_name}} 17.1 [During Term] and 17.2 [After Termination, Expiration, or {{party_name}}] by engaging in prohibited activity indirectly through any other person or entity. 17.5. Enforcement. You agree that the existence of any claim you may have against us, whether or not arising from this {{party_name}}, will not constitute a defense to our enforcement of {{effective_date}}. You agree to pay all costs and expenses that we reasonably incur in enforcing {{effective_date}}, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. You acknowledge that a violation of the terms of {{effective_date}} would result in irreparable injury to us for which no adequate remedy at law may be available. Accordingly, you consent to the issuance of an injunction prohibiting any conduct in violation of the terms of {{effective_date}}.

The fee for the mediation, however, will be split equally. 25.2. Forum for Litigation. You and the {{party_name}} must file any suit against us, and we may file any suit against you, in the federal or state court where our principal office is located at the time the suit is filed.
