Except as expressly set forth in this {{party_name}}, neither this {{party_name}} nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under this {{party_name}}, including the licenses granted pursuant to this {{party_name}}, shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of {{party_name}} or otherwise by either {{party_name}} without the prior written consent of the other {{party_name}}. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any {{party_name}} to this {{party_name}} (or any of its successors or permitted assigns) (a) shall enter into a consolidation or merger transaction in which such {{party_name}} is not the surviving entity and the surviving entity acquires or assumes all or substantially all of such {{party_name}}’s assets, (b) shall transfer all or substantially all of such {{party_name}}’s assets to any {{party_name}} or (c) shall assign this {{party_name}} to such {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}}, then, in each such case, the assigning {{party_name}} (or its successors or permitted assigns, as applicable) shall ensure that the assignee or successor-in-interest expressly assumes in writing all of the obligations of the assigning {{party_name}} under this {{party_name}}, and the assigning {{party_name}} shall not be required to seek consent, but shall provide written notice and evidence of such assignment, assumption or succession to the non-assigning {{party_name}}. Subject to the preceding sentences, this {{party_name}} will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. No assignment permitted by this Section 8.01 shall release the assigning {{party_name}} from liability for the full performance of its obligations under this {{party_name}}. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event will the licenses granted in this {{party_name}} extend to products, services or other activities of the assignee existing on or before the date of the transaction described in clauses (a) or (b) of the preceding sentence, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this {{party_name}} prior to such transaction. Section 8.02. {{party_name}}. In the event a {{party_name}} divests a line of business or line of products or services by (a) spinning off a member of its {{party_name}} by its sale or other disposition to a Third {{party_name}}, (b) reducing ownership or control in a member of its {{party_name}} so that it no longer qualifiers as a member of its {{party_name}} under this {{party_name}}, (c) selling or otherwise transferring such line of business, products or services to a Third {{party_name}} or (d) forming a joint venture with a Third {{party_name}} with respect to such line of business, products or services (each such divested entity or line of business, products or services, a “Divested Entity”), the Divested Entity 12 Source: C{{party_name}}, 8-K, {{effective_date}} shall retain those licenses granted to it under this {{party_name}}, provided that the license shall be limited to the business, products or services (as applicable) of the Divested Entity as of the date of divestment and such natural development thereof within the {{party_name}} Field of Use (where {{party_name}} is the divesting {{party_name}}) or SpinCo Field of Use (where SpinCo is the divesting party). The retention of any license grants are subject to {{party_name}} and, in the event it is acquired by a Third {{party_name}}, such Third {{party_name}}’s execution and delivery to the non-transferring {{party_name}}, within {{effective_date}} of the effective date of such divestment, of a duly authorized, written undertaking, agreeing to be bound by the applicable terms of this {{party_name}}. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) in no event will the licenses retained by a Divested Entity extend to products, services or other activities of a Third {{party_name}} acquirer existing on or before the date of the divestment, except to the extent that they were licensed under the terms of this {{party_name}} prior to such divestment, and (ii) in the event that a Divested Entity owns any {{party_name}} licensed to the other {{party_name}} under this {{party_name}}, such {{party_name}} may be transferred or assignment with such Divested Entity subject to the terms and conditions this {{party_name}}.

Section 11.02. {{party_name}} Resolution.
