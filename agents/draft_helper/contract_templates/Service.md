If an {{party_name}} {{party_name}} is entitled to indemnification hereunder because of a claim asserted by any claimant (other than a Constellation {{party_name}} Person or {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Person) (a “Third Person”), the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} shall give the Indemnifying {{party_name}} reasonably prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}; provided, however, that the right of a person or entity to be indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be adversely affected by a failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an Indemnifying {{party_name}} is actually irrevocably and materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall have the right, upon written notice to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, and using counsel reasonably satisfactory to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, to investigate, contest or settle the claim alleged by such Third Person (a “Third Person Claim”), provided that the Indemnifying {{party_name}} has unconditionally acknowledged to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} in writing its obligation to indemnify the persons and entities to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim and to discharge (and does in fact so discharge) any cost or expense arising out of such investigation, contest or settlement. The {{party_name}} {{party_name}} may thereafter participate in (but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying {{party_name}}. Unless and until the Indemnifying {{party_name}} so acknowledges its obligation to indemnify, the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} shall have the right, at its option, to assume and control defense of the matter and to look to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} for the full amount of the reasonable costs of defense. The failure of the Indemnifying {{party_name}} to respond in writing to the aforesaid notice of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} with respect to such Third Person Claim within thirty ({{effective_date}} after receipt thereof shall be deemed an irrevocable election not to defend the same. If the Indemnifying {{party_name}} does not so acknowledge its obligation to indemnify and assume the defense of any such Third Person Claim, (i) the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} may defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as it may reasonably deem appropriate, including, but not limited to, settling such claim, after giving notice of the same to the Indemnifying {{party_name}}, on such terms as the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} may reasonably deem appropriate, and (ii) the Indemnifying {{party_name}} may participate in (but not control) the defense of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying {{party_name}} thereafter seeks to question the manner in which the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} defended such Third Person Claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall have the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that conduct of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} in the defense and/or settlement of such Third Person Claim constituted gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Parties shall make available to each other all relevant information in their possession relating to any such Third Person Claim and shall cooperate in the defense thereof.

In the event that either {{party_name}} or any of its representatives becomes legally compelled to disclose any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, such {{party_name}} shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, provide the other {{party_name}} with prompt written notice before such disclosure, sufficient to enable such other {{party_name}} either to seek a protective order, at its expense, or another appropriate remedy preventing or prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this Section, or both. 6.11 {{party_name}}.

No waiver of full performance by a {{party_name}} shall be construed, or operate, as a waiver of any subsequent default of any of the terms, covenants and conditions of this Agreement. The payment or acceptance of fees or charges for any period after a default shall not be deemed a waiver of any right or acceptance of defective performance. 6.17 Severability. If any provision of this Agreement shall be determined to be contrary to law and unenforceable by any court of law, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby are not affected in any manner materially adverse to any {{party_name}}. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible. 6.18 Third {{party_name}} Beneficiaries.

The {{party_name}} represents and warrants to {{party_name}} that any registration statement, prospectus, and statement of additional information, when such registration statement becomes effective, will include all statements required to be contained therein in conformity with the {{effective_date}} Act, the {{effective_date}} Act, and the rules and regulations of the {{party_name}}; that all statements of fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information will be true and correct when such registration statement becomes effective; and that neither any registration statement nor any prospectus or statement of additional information when such registration statement becomes effective will include an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading to a purchaser of {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} may, but shall not be obligated to, propose from time to time such amendment or amendments to any registration statement and such supplement or supplements to any prospectus or statement of additional information as, in the light of future developments, may, in the opinion of {{party_name}}’s counsel, be necessary or advisable. If the {{party_name}} shall not propose such amendment or amendments and/or supplement or supplements within fifteen {{effective_date}} after receipt by the {{party_name}} of a written request from {{party_name}} to do so, {{party_name}} may, at its option, terminate this Agreement.

The {{party_name}} agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold {{party_name}}, its several officers and governors, and any person who controls {{party_name}} within the meaning of Section 15 of the {{effective_date}} Act, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, demands, liabilities, and expenses (including the cost of investigating or defending such claims, demands, or liabilities and any counsel fees incurred in connection therewith) which {{party_name}}, its officers and governors, or any such controlling person may incur under the {{effective_date}} Act, the {{effective_date}} Act, or common law or otherwise, arising out of or based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or arising out of or based upon any omission or alleged omission to state a material fact required to be stated in any registration statement, any prospectus, or any statement of additional information, or necessary to make the statements in any of them not misleading; provided, however, that the {{party_name}}’s agreement to indemnify {{party_name}}, its officers or governors, and any such controlling person shall not be deemed to cover any claims, demands, liabilities, or expenses arising out of or based upon any statements or representations made by {{party_name}} or its representatives or agents other than such statements and representations as are contained in any registration statement, prospectus, or statement of additional information and in such financial and other statements as are furnished to {{party_name}} pursuant to paragraph 2.2 hereof; and further provided that the {{party_name}}’s agreement to indemnify {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}}’s representations and warranties hereinbefore set forth in paragraph 3 shall not be deemed to cover any liability to the {{party_name}} or its shareholders to which {{party_name}} would otherwise be subject by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith, or gross negligence in the performance of its duties, or by reason of {{party_name}}’s reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under this Agreement.
