A transfer occurs when: (1) the original or authorized subsequent licensee tries to convey or reassign its right to use the {{party_name}} to another entity, or (2) the original lessor of {{party_name}} used hardware (including bundled {{party_name}}) ("{{party_name}}") tries to reassign the original lessee's right to use the {{party_name}} to another lessee, or the lessor tries to convey or reassign its right to lease the {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} bundle to another lessor. A rental would be treated the same as the lease situation as described in item 2 above. This policy applies to all {{party_name}} whether {{party_name}} or Embedded. {{party_name}} {{party_name}} is {{party_name}} which is not required to operate the {{party_name}} upon which it resides (i.e., ICSG software such as call center, unified messaging, network management software). Embedded {{party_name}} is {{party_name}} which is incorporated into the {{party_name}} and is required for its operation (i.e., operating system software, certain features of {{party_name}}). Policy: {{party_name}}'s policy is that {{party_name}}, whether {{party_name}} or Embedded, is not transferable, except where a listed exception below applies, and except, of course, where {{party_name}}'s contract expressly allows it. Any other transfers will require the payment of a new license fee (see {{party_name}}). For products where there is no separate line item for the {{party_name}} (i.e. the prices for both the {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} are bundled), and therefore, a fee cannot be determined, an exception will be made to allow for the transfer without the customer being required to obtain a new license (the customer may be required to pay an inspection fee), if (A) {{party_name}} to be transferred (i) will be under a support contract provided by either {{party_name}} or a {{party_name}}​‐ authorized support partner or (ii) is still supported by {{party_name}}; or (B) approval from the theatre Sales {{party_name}} has been obtained. Use of the {{party_name}} will be governed by either the original license terms and conditions in place between {{party_name}} and the original {{party_name}} licensee or by the new license between {{party_name}} and the new user. {{party_name}} may withhold its consent to any transfer not conforming to this policy. {{party_name}}: The {{party_name}} is generally the same amount as the fee charged for a new license or a portion of the fee of a new license, unless otherwise noted on the {{party_name}}. It is the obligation of the transferor to obtain {{party_name}}'s consent and/or a new license before the transfer occurs. Exceptions: Provided the conditions of transfer are met as set forth below, the follow exceptions apply to the prohibition against transfer without written approval and payment of the applicable fee. These exceptions may be overridden by express terms in an applicable licensing agreement governing the transferability of Special License {{party_name}} (Special License {{party_name}} is the term now used in our templates to refer to ICSG {{party_name}}) {{party_name}}: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of {{party_name}} to its {{party_name}}. An {{party_name}} is another entity where {{amount}} of its voting power is owned or controlled by the transferring entity or where {{amount}} of the transferring entity's voting power is owned or controlled by the transferee. Merger or Acquisition: An entity may transfer its right to use a certain piece of {{party_name}} to the purchaser of all or substantially all of the capital stock of the transferor or all or substantially all of the assets of that portion of the transferor's business to which those licenses pertain. Lease: In a leasing situation where the original lessee/customer would like to buy out the equipment from the leasing company during or at the end of the lease term, the original lessee/customer may retain the license without paying a new {{party_name}}, provided leasing company gives {{party_name}} prior written notice.
