Upon notice by {{party_name}} to the {{party_name}} of any determination to commence a {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} shall, except as required by applicable law, including any disclosure obligations under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, keep the fact of any such {{party_name}} strictly confidential, and during any {{party_name}}, promptly halt any offer, sale (including sales pursuant to Rule {{effective_date}}4), trading or transfer of any {{party_name}} for the duration of the {{party_name}} until {{party_name}} has provided notice that the {{party_name}} has been terminated. (b)If {{party_name}} suspends the use of a {{party_name}} pursuant to {{effective_date}}), the holders of {{party_name}} shall receive an extension of the registration period under Section 13.1(a)(ii) and 13.1(c) equal to the number of {{effective_date}} of the suspension. 24 (c)The {{party_name}} agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from {{party_name}} of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in {{effective_date}}) or Section 13.4(e) or a condition described in {{effective_date}}), each {{party_name}} Unit-Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of {{party_name}} pursuant to {{party_name}} covering the sale of {{party_name}} until the {{party_name}} receive copies of the supplemented or amended {{party_name}} contemplated by {{effective_date}}) or Section 13.6(d) or notice from {{party_name}} of the termination of the stop order or {{party_name}}. (d)After the expiration of any {{party_name}} and without any further request from a holder of {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall use its commercially reasonably efforts to prepare a {{party_name}}, or post-effective amendment or supplement to {{party_name}} or {{party_name}} or any document incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of {{party_name}} included therein, the {{party_name}} will not include a material misstatement or omission or be not effective and useable for the sale of {{party_name}}. 13.7Market {{party_name}}. (a)In connection with any {{party_name}} that is the {{party_name}}, or any {{party_name}} in which the {{party_name}} are selling {{party_name}} pursuant to Sections 13.1 or 13.2, each {{party_name}} Unit-Holder agrees that, during the period of duration (up to 180 {{effective_date}}, subject to customary extensions as may be required by the underwriter or underwriters up to a maximum of 2{{effective_date}} {{effective_date}}) specified by {{party_name}} and the underwriter or underwriters of {{party_name}}, following the date of the final prospectus or other offering document distributed in connection with the {{party_name}}, it shall not, to the extent requested by {{party_name}} and such underwriter or underwriters, directly or indirectly, sell, offer to sell, contract to sell (including any short sale or other hedging transaction), grant any option to purchase or otherwise transfer any {{party_name}} held by it at any time during such period except for such {{party_name}} as shall be included in such registration. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the obligations described in this Section 13.7(a) shall not apply (i) to a registration relating solely to employee benefit plans on Form S-1 or Form S-8, (ii) to a registration relating solely to an acquisition or similar transaction on Form S-4 or (iii) unless all holders then holding {{amount}} of the issued and outstanding {{party_name}} (and/or any securities of {{party_name}} or any successor entity into which the {{party_name}} are converted, exchanged or redesignated) with a contractual obligation enforceable by {{party_name}} or its affiliates to do so and all of the then-current executive officers and directors (if applicable) of {{party_name}} enter into similar agreements.

The {{party_name}} will bear and pay any fees and expenses of {{party_name}} or its affiliates or their {{party_name}}, including their counsel, and any underwriting discounts, fees and commissions and any transfer taxes applicable to {{party_name}} offered for its account pursuant to any {{party_name}}. 13.9Indemnification; Contribution. (a)In connection with any registration of {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} will indemnify, defend and hold harmless each {{party_name}} Unit-Holder, its affiliates, directors, officers and {{party_name}} and each person who controls {{party_name}} Unit-Holder within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act (collectively, the “{{party_name}}s”) from and against any and all direct losses, claims, damages, liabilities, obligations, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, as a result of any notices, actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands, assessments, judgments, awards, costs, penalties, taxes and reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ and other professionals’ fees and disbursements, but excluding any consequential damages) (collectively “{{party_name}}es”) caused by (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any part of any {{party_name}} or any {{party_name}}, including any amendment or supplement thereto, used in connection with {{party_name}} or any Issuer FWP or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of a {{party_name}}, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made) not misleading; provided, however, that {{party_name}} will not be required to indemnify any {{party_name}} for any {{party_name}}es resulting from any such untrue statement or omission if such untrue statement or omission was made in reliance on and in conformity with information with respect to any {{party_name}} furnished to {{party_name}} in writing by, or on behalf of, any of the {{party_name}} expressly for use therein. (b)In connection with any {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} or Issuer FWP, each {{party_name}} Unit-Holder, jointly and severally, will indemnify, defend and 26 hold harmless {{party_name}}, its directors, its officers and each person, if any, who controls {{party_name}} (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from {{party_name}} to each {{party_name}} Unit-Holder, but only with respect to information furnished to {{party_name}} in writing by, or on behalf of, any {{party_name}} Unit-Holder or any {{party_name}}s expressly for use in such {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} or Issuer FWP; and provided, further, however, that in no event shall the liability for indemnity of any {{party_name}} Unit-Holder under this Section {{effective_date}}) exceed the dollar amount of the proceeds (net of any underwriting discount or commission or other selling expenses) received by such {{party_name}} Unit-Holder from the sale of {{party_name}} giving rise to such indemnification. (c)In case any claim, action or proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to Section 13.9(a) or {{effective_date}}), such person ({{party_name}}”) will promptly, but in any event within {{effective_date}}, notify the person against whom such indemnity may be sought ({{party_name}}”) in writing, and {{party_name}} shall have the right to participate in, and to the extent {{party_name}} so desires, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}; provided, that the failure of any {{party_name}} {{party_name}} to give notice within the time limit provided herein shall not relieve {{party_name}} of its obligations under Section 13.9(a) or {{effective_date}}), except to the extent that {{party_name}} is actually and materially prejudiced by such failure to give notice. In any such claim, action or proceeding where {{party_name}} has assumed the defense thereof, the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} shall have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in any such defense and to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel will be at the expense of such {{party_name}} {{party_name}} unless the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} have been advised by counsel that representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential conflicting interests between them. It is understood that {{party_name}} will not, in connection with any claim, action or proceeding or related claims, actions or proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to any local counsel) at any time for all such {{party_name}} Parties and that all such reasonable fees and expenses will be reimbursed as they are incurred. In the case of the retention of any such separate firm for the {{party_name}} Parties, such firm will be designated in writing by the {{party_name}} Parties. No {{party_name}} {{party_name}} will, without the prior written consent of {{party_name}}, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any {{party_name}} {{party_name}} is seeking indemnity hereunder. {{party_name}} will not be liable for any settlement of any claim, action or proceeding effected without its written consent, but if such claim, action or proceeding is settled with such consent or if there has been a final judgment for the plaintiff, {{party_name}} agrees to indemnify the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} from and against any {{party_name}} by reason of such settlement or judgment. {{party_name}} will, without the prior written consent of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, settle, compromise or offer to settle or compromise any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which any {{party_name}} {{party_name}} is seeking indemnity hereunder, unless such settlement includes (i) an 27 unconditional release of such {{party_name}} {{party_name}} from all liability in connection with such proceeding, (ii) no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} or any of its {{party_name}} can be made as the result of such action, and (iii) the sole relief (if any) provided is monetary damages that are reimbursed in full by {{party_name}}. (d)If the indemnification provided for in this Section 13.9 from {{party_name}} is unavailable to an {{party_name}} {{party_name}} hereunder or is insufficient in respect of any {{party_name}}es referred to in this Section 13.9, then {{party_name}}, in lieu of indemnifying such {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, will contribute to the amount paid or payable by such {{party_name}} {{party_name}} as a result of such {{party_name}}es (i) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} {{party_name}} in connection with the actions that resulted in such {{party_name}}es, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations, or (ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative fault referred to in clause (i) but also the relative benefit of {{party_name}}, on the one hand, and each {{party_name}} Unit-Holder, on the other, in connection with the statements or omissions that resulted in such {{party_name}}es, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations; provided, however, that in no event shall a {{party_name}} Unit-Holder be required by {{effective_date}}) to contribute an aggregate amount in excess of the dollar amount of proceeds (net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other selling expenses) received by such {{party_name}} Unit-Holder from the sale of {{party_name}} giving rise to such contribution. The relative fault of such {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} {{party_name}} will be determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, has been taken by, or relates to information supplied by, such {{party_name}} or {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, and the parties’ relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the {{party_name}}es referred to above will be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in {{effective_date}}), any reasonable out of pocket legal or other out of pocket fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection with any investigation or proceeding. (e)The parties agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to {{effective_date}}) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to in {{effective_date}}). No person guilty of “fraudulent misrepresentation” (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) will be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section {{effective_date}}), a {{party_name}} Unit-Holder shall not be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the net proceeds received by such {{party_name}} Unit-Holder from the sale of {{party_name}} exceeds the amount of any damages which such {{party_name}} Unit-Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. 28 (f)If indemnification is available under this Section 13.9, {{party_name}} will indemnify each {{party_name}} {{party_name}} to the fullest extent permissible under applicable law provided in Sections 13.9(a) and {{effective_date}}) without regard to the relative fault of said {{party_name}} or {{party_name}} {{party_name}} or any other equitable consideration provided for in {{effective_date}}) or {{effective_date}}). The obligations of {{party_name}} under this Section 13.9 shall be in addition to any liability that {{party_name}} may otherwise have to any {{party_name}}. (g)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this {{party_name}}, each of the {{party_name}} Parties has relied on this Section 13.9, is an express third party beneficiary of this Section 13.9 and is entitled to enforce the obligations of the applicable {{party_name}} Parties under this Section 13.9 directly against such {{party_name}} Parties to the full extent thereof. 13.10Rule {{effective_date}}4. For so long as {{party_name}} is subject to the requirements of Section 13, {{effective_date}} or 15(d) of the Securities Act, {{party_name}} agrees that it will use its reasonable best efforts to (i) make and keep public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule {{effective_date}}4 and (ii) file the reports required to be filed by it under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. 13.11Transfer of Registration Rights. The rights to cause {{party_name}} to register securities granted to the {{party_name}} under this ARTICLE XIII may be assigned by the {{party_name}} with the consent of {{party_name}}, except that the {{party_name}} may assign such rights to their {{party_name}} without the consent of {{party_name}}. 13.12Termination of Registration Rights. The registration rights contained in Section 13.1 shall automatically terminate when the {{party_name}} collectively hold {{party_name}} in an amount less than (i) {{amount}} of the issued and outstanding {{party_name}} (and/or any securities of {{party_name}} or any successor entity into which the {{party_name}} are converted, exchanged or redesignated) and (ii) the average {{effective_date}} reported volume of trading in {{party_name}} (and/or any securities of {{party_name}} or any successor entity into which the {{party_name}} Units are converted, exchanged or redesignated) on all national securities exchanges and/or reported through the automated quotation system of a registered securities association for {{effective_date}} preceding the date on which such determination is made.
