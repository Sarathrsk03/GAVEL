Method 1. (a). Bizzingo will acquire basic business information for a prospective user of the {{party_name}}, which will include all or part of the following; business name and address, telephone number, email address or website. This basic business information will be acquired through (i) arrangements with specific groups, clubs, networks, or associations, such as {{party_name}}, Universities, or trade organization, to acquire member information, or (ii) through purchase or license arrangements with content providers. In either case, once Bizzingo obtains information for a specific user, it will use that information to create or seed a separate user profile in its database for that prospective user (“{{party_name}}”). As of the date of this {{party_name}}, Bizzingo has arrangements with content providers and associations to provide the basic business information for over 6,000,000 prospective users which will be seeded by Bizzingo. For clarification purposes, at this point in the process, a {{party_name}} is not an “Activated User.” (b). In order to activate a {{party_name}}, Bizzingo will contact a prospective user informing them of the existence of their {{party_name}} on the {{party_name}}, and the prospective user is then required to: (i) search and locate the Bizzingo database for its {{party_name}} and (ii) claim the {{party_name}} by editing or adding content to the {{party_name}}. Once the steps set forth in the immediately preceding sentence has been completed by a user, that user will be deemed to be an “Activated User” and the {{party_name}} will identify that user as an Activated User. Method 2. A prospective user independently (from Method 1) may create its own user profile on the {{party_name}}. This user will be deemed an Activated User and the {{party_name}} will identify that user as an “Activated User.” II {{party_name}} and {{party_name}}. {{party_name}}. The {{party_name}} payable under the {{party_name}} shall be in the form of one (1) common stock purchase warrant of Bizzingo (as further described herein) for each Activated User (as defined above) that occurs during a {{party_name}} Period determined on {{effective_date}} of each {{party_name}} Period during the {{party_name}}. It being the intent of the parties that no more than one (1) common stock purchase warrant shall be issued per Activated User, and by way of example, if on {{effective_date}} of the first and second {{party_name}} Periods, the {{party_name}} has 500,000 and 1,500,000 Activated Users, respectively, {{party_name}} shall receive 500,000 common stock purchase warrants for the first {{party_name}} Period and an additional {{amount}},000 common stock purchase warrants for the second {{party_name}} Period. Each common stock purchase warrant shall enable {{party_name}} to acquire one (1) share of common stock of Bizzingo at an exercise price of ${{amount}} per share during a term of five (5) {{effective_date}} from the end of the applicable {{party_name}} Period. The form of the warrant is attached hereto as {{party_name}}-l and shall be referred to as the “{{party_name}} Warrant." 9 Source: BIZZINGO, INC., 8-K, {{effective_date}} 2. {{party_name}}.
