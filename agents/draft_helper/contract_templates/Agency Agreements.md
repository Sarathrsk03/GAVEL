An indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of such action. In addition, if it so elects within a reasonable time after receipt of such notice, an indemnifying party, jointly with any other indemnifying parties receiving such notice, may assume defense of such action with counsel chosen by it and approved by the indemnified parties that are defendants in such action, unless such indemnified parties reasonably object to such assumption on the ground that there may be legal defenses available to them that are different from or in addition to those available to such indemnifying party.

In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (and any special counsel that said firm may retain) for each indemnified party in connection with any one action, proceeding or claim or separate but similar or related actions, proceedings or claims in the same jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances. Section 10. Contribution. In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} or the Agent, the {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities 29 (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} or the Agent from persons other than the other parties thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the {{party_name}} from the sale of the {{party_name}} in the Offering, and the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} on the one hand and the Agent on the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties’ relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent’s liability is essential to the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} and the Agent under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the {{party_name}} and the Agent may otherwise have. For purposes of this Section 10, each of the Agent’s, the {{party_name}}’s or the {{party_name}}’s officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the Agent or the {{party_name}} or the {{party_name}} within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the {{effective_date}} Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent on the one hand, or, the {{party_name}} or the {{party_name}} on the other hand. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10. Section 11. Survival of Agreements, Representations and Indemnities. The respective indemnities of the {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} and the Agent, the representations and warranties and other statements of the {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} and the Agent set forth in or made pursuant to this Agreement and the provisions relating to contribution shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any termination or cancellation of this Agreement or any investigation made by or on behalf of the Agent, the {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} or any controlling person referred to in Section 9 hereof, and shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the issuance of the {{party_name}}, and any successor or assign of the Agent, the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}}, and any such controlling person shall be entitled to the benefit of the respective agreements, indemnities, warranties and representations. 30 Section 12. Termination. The Agent may terminate this Agreement by giving the notice indicated below in this Section 12 at any time after this Agreement becomes effective as follows: (a) If any domestic or international event or act or occurrence has materially disrupted the United States securities markets such as to make it, in the Agent’s reasonable opinion, impracticable to proceed with the offering of the {{party_name}}; or if trading on the {{party_name}} shall have suspended (except that this shall not apply to the imposition of {{party_name}} trading collars imposed on program trading); or if the United States shall have become involved in a war or major hostilities; or if a general banking moratorium has been declared by a state or federal authority which has a material effect on the {{party_name}} on a consolidated basis; or if a moratorium in foreign exchange trading by major international banks or persons has been declared; or if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the {{party_name}}, or if the {{party_name}} shall have sustained a material or substantial loss by fire, flood, accident, hurricane, earthquake, theft, sabotage or other calamity or malicious act, whether or not said loss shall have been insured; or if there shall have been a material adverse change in the financial condition, results of operations or business of the {{party_name}}. (b) In the event the {{party_name}} fails to sell the required minimum number of the {{party_name}} by the date when such sales must be completed, in accordance with the provisions of the {{party_name}} or as required by {{party_name}}, and applicable law, this Agreement shall terminate upon refund by the {{party_name}} to each person who has subscribed for or ordered any of the {{party_name}} the full amount which it may have received from such person, together with interest as provided in the {{party_name}}, and no party to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other hereunder, except as set forth in {{party_name}}(a) and (d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof. (c) If any of the conditions specified in Section 8 shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement, unless waived in writing, or by the {{party_name}} Date, this Agreement and all of the Agent’s obligations hereunder may be cancelled by the Agent by notifying the {{party_name}} of such cancellation in writing or by telegram at any time at or prior to the {{party_name}} Date, and any such cancellation shall be without liability of any party to any other party except as otherwise provided in {{party_name}}(a), 2(d), 7, 9 and 10 hereof.

The {{party_name}} or the {{party_name}} may terminate this Agreement in the event the Agent is in material breach of the representations and warranties or covenants contained in Section 5 and such breach has not been cured after the {{party_name}} or the {{party_name}} has provided the Agent with notice of such breach.

(b) Disaster Out If prior to {{party_name}} there should develop, occur or come into effect or existence any event, action, state, condition or major financial occurrence of national or international consequence or any law or regulation which, in the opinion of any of the {{party_name}}, seriously adversely affects, or involves, or will seriously adversely affect, or involve, the financial markets or the business, operations or affairs of the {{party_name}} and its subsidiaries taken as a whole, then such Agent shall be entitled, at its option and in accordance with Section 10(e), to terminate its obligations under this Agreement by written notice to that effect given to the {{party_name}} at any time at or prior to {{party_name}}.

Each Agent may waive, in whole or in part, or extend the time for compliance with, any terms and conditions without prejudice to its rights in respect of any other terms and conditions or any other or subsequent breach or non- compliance, provided that any such waiver or extension shall be binding upon an Agent only if such waiver or extension is in writing and signed by the Agent. 20 (e) Exercise of Termination Rights The rights of termination contained in Sections 10(a), (b), (c) and (d) may be exercised by any of the {{party_name}} and are in addition to any other rights or remedies any of the {{party_name}} may have in respect of any default, act or failure to act or non- compliance by the {{party_name}} in respect of any of the matters contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise. In the event of any such termination, there shall be no further liability on the part of the {{party_name}} to the {{party_name}} or on the part of the {{party_name}} to the {{party_name}} except in respect of any liability which may have arisen prior to or arise after such termination under Sections 11, {{effective_date}} and {{effective_date}}. A notice of termination given by an Agent under Section 10(a), (b), (c) or (d) shall not be binding upon any other Agent who has not also executed such notice. 11. Indemnity (a) Rights of Indemnity (1) The {{party_name}} covenants and agrees to protect, indemnify, and save harmless, each of the {{party_name}} and their respective affiliates, and each and every one of the directors, officers, employees, partners and agents of the {{party_name}} (individually, an “{{party_name}} Party” and collectively, the “{{party_name}} Parties”) harmless from and against any and all expenses, losses (excluding loss of profits), claims, actions, damages (other than consequential or punitive damages) or liabilities, joint or several (including the aggregate amount paid in settlement of any actions, suits, proceedings or claims and the reasonable fees and expenses of their counsel that may be incurred in advising with respect to and/or defending any claim that may be made against the {{party_name}} Parties) to which any {{party_name}} Party may become subject or otherwise involved in any capacity under any statute or co{{party_name}}on law or otherwise insofar as such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions arise out of or are based, directly or indirectly, upon the performance of professional services rendered to the {{party_name}} by the {{party_name}} Parties (or any of them), whether directly or indirectly, including by reason of: (a) any information or statement contained in this Agreement, the {{party_name}}’s publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the {{party_name}} used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the {{party_name}} delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto, which at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made contains or is alleged to contain a misrepresentation or any misstatement of a material fact; {{effective_date}} (b) the omission or alleged omission to state in in this Agreement, the {{party_name}}’s publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the {{party_name}} used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the {{party_name}} delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto, any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein not misleading in light of the circumstances in which it was made; (c) any order made, or inquiry, investigation or proceeding co{{party_name}}enced by any securities regulatory authority or other competent authority based upon any misrepresentation, untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission in this Agreement, the {{party_name}}’s publicly available disclosed documents filed on SEDAR or elsewhere, or in any other material prepared by the {{party_name}} used for marketing the Offering or any certificate of the {{party_name}} delivered hereunder or pursuant hereto that prevents or restricts the trading in any of the {{party_name}}’s securities or the distribution or distribution to the public, as the case may be, of any of the {{party_name}} in any of the Qualifying Jurisdictions; (d) the {{party_name}} not complying with any requirement of {{party_name}} or stock exchange requirements in connection with the transactions contemplated herein, including the {{party_name}}’s non-compliance with any statutory requirement to make any document available for inspection; or (e) any breach of a representation or warranty of the {{party_name}} contained in this Agreement or the failure of the {{party_name}} to comply with any of its obligations hereunder. (2) Notwithstanding Subsection 11(a) (1), the indemnification in {{effective_date}}) does not and shall not apply to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction in a final judgment that has become non- appealable shall determine that (a) the {{party_name}} and their respective affiliates have been negligent or have co{{party_name}}itted any fraudulent or illegal act in the course of the professional services rendered to the {{party_name}}, and (b) such expenses, losses, claims, damages, liabilities or actions were caused or incurred by the gross negligence, fraud or wilful misconduct of the {{party_name}}. (3) If any matter or thing contemplated by this Section 11 shall be asserted against any {{party_name}} Party in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such {{party_name}} Party will notify the {{party_name}} in writing as soon as possible of the nature of such claim (provided that omission to so notify the {{party_name}} will not relieve the {{party_name}} of any liability that it may otherwise have to the {{party_name}} Party hereunder, except to the extent the {{party_name}} is materially prejudiced by such omission) and the {{party_name}} shall be entitled (but not required) to assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such claim; provided, however, that the defence shall be through legal counsel reasonably acceptable to such {{party_name}} Party and that no settlement may be made by the {{party_name}} or such {{party_name}} Party without the prior written consent of the other, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld. 22 (4) In any such claim, such {{party_name}} Party shall have the right to retain other legal counsel to act on such {{party_name}} Party’s behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such other legal counsel shall be paid by such {{party_name}} Party, unless: (a) the employment of such counsel has been authorized by the {{party_name}}; or (b) the {{party_name}} has not assumed the defence and employed counsel thereof promptly after receiving notice of such claim; or (c) the named parties to any such claim include both the {{party_name}} Party and the {{party_name}}, and the {{party_name}} Party has been advised by legal counsel thereto that representation of both the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} Party by the same legal counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them; or (d) there are one or more defences available to the {{party_name}} Party which are different from and in addition to those available to the {{party_name}}, provided that the {{party_name}} shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the {{party_name}} Parties. (5) To the extent that any {{party_name}} Party is not a party to this Underwriting Agreement, the {{party_name}} shall obtain and hold the right and benefit of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such {{party_name}} Party. (6) The {{party_name}} hereby consents to personal jurisdiction in any court in which any claim that is subject to indemnification hereunder is brought against the {{party_name}} or any {{party_name}} Party and to the assignment of the benefit of this Section 11 to any {{party_name}} Party for the purpose of enforcement provided that nothing herein shall limit the {{party_name}}’s right or ability to contest the appropriate jurisdiction or forum for the determination of any such claims. (7) The rights of the {{party_name}} contained in this Section 11 shall not enure to the benefit of any {{party_name}} Party if the {{party_name}} were provided with a copy of any amendment or supplement to this Agreement which corrects any untrue statement or omission or alleged omission that is the basis of a claim by a party against such {{party_name}} Party and that is required, under the {{party_name}}, to be delivered to such party by the {{party_name}}. (8) The {{party_name}} shall not be liable under this Section 11 for any settlement of any claim or action effected without its prior written consent. 23 (b) Notification of {{party_name}}s If any matter or thing contemplated by Section 11(a) (any such matter or thing being referred to as a “{{party_name}}”) is asserted against any person or company in respect of which indemnification is or might reasonably be considered to be provided, such person or company (the “{{party_name}} Party”) will notify the {{party_name}} as soon as possible of the nature of such {{party_name}} (but the omission so to notify the {{party_name}} of any potential {{party_name}} shall not relieve the {{party_name}} from any liability which they may have to any {{party_name}} Party and any omission so to notify the {{party_name}} of any actual {{party_name}} shall affect the {{party_name}}’s liability only to the extent that the {{party_name}} is materially prejudiced by that failure). The {{party_name}} shall assume the defence of any suit brought to enforce such {{party_name}}, provided, however, that (i) the defence shall be conducted through legal counsel acceptable to the {{party_name}} Party, acting reasonably, and (ii) no settlement of any such {{party_name}} or admission of liability may be made by the {{party_name}} without the prior written consent of the {{party_name}} Party, acting reasonably, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the {{party_name}} Party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or failure to act, by or on behalf of any {{party_name}} Party. (c) Right of Indemnity in Favour of Others With respect to any {{party_name}} Party who is not a party to this Agreement, the {{party_name}} shall obtain and hold the rights and benefits of this Section 11 in trust for and on behalf of such {{party_name}} Party. (d) Retaining Counsel In any such {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} Party shall have the right to retain one separate counsel to act on his or its behalf, provided that the fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be paid by the {{party_name}} Party unless: (i) the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} Party shall have mutually agreed in writing to the retention of the other counsel; (ii) the named parties to any such {{party_name}} (including any added third or impleaded party) include both the {{party_name}} Party and the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} Party shall have been advised in writing by counsel to the {{party_name}} Party that the representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest between the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} Party; or (iii) the {{party_name}} shall not have retained counsel within {{effective_date}} following receipt by the {{party_name}} of notice of any such {{party_name}} from the {{party_name}} Party; provided that the {{party_name}} shall not be responsible for the fees or expenses of more than one legal firm in any single jurisdiction for all of the {{party_name}} Parties. 24 {{effective_date}}. Contribution (a) Rights of Contribution In order to provide for a just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity provided in Section 11 would otherwise be available in accordance with its terms but is, for any reason, held to be unavailable to or unenforceable by the {{party_name}} or enforceable otherwise than in accordance with its terms, the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} shall contribute to the aggregate of all claims, expenses, costs and liabilities and all losses (other than loss of profits) of a nature contemplated by Section 11 in such proportions so that the {{party_name}} shall be responsible for the portion represented by the percentage that the aggregate {{party_name}}’ Fee hereunder bears to the aggregate offering price of the {{party_name}} being sold by the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} shall be responsible for the balance, whether or not they have been sued together or sued separately, provided, however, that (i) the {{party_name}} shall not in any event be liable to contribute, in the aggregate, any amounts in excess of the aggregate {{party_name}}’ Fee actually received by the {{party_name}} from the {{party_name}} under this Agreement; (ii) each Agent shall not in any event be liable to contribute, individually, any amount in excess of such {{party_name}}’ portion of the aggregate {{party_name}}’ Fee actually received from the {{party_name}} under this Agreement; and (iii) no party who has engaged in any fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or negligence shall be entitled to claim contribution from any person who has not engaged in such fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation, wilful misconduct or negligence. (b) Rights of Contribution in Addition to Other Rights The rights to contribution provided in this Section {{effective_date}} shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other right to contribution which the {{party_name}} may have by statute or otherwise at law. (c) Right of Contribution in Favour of Others With respect to this Section {{effective_date}}, the {{party_name}} acknowledges and agrees that the {{party_name}} are contracting on their own behalf and as agents for their affiliates, directors, officers, employees and agents. For purposes of this Section {{effective_date}}, each person, if any, who controls an Agent within the meaning of Section {{effective_date}} of {{party_name}} or Section 20 of {{party_name}} and each {{party_name}}’ affiliates and selling agents shall have the same rights to contribution as such Agent and each person, if any, who controls the {{party_name}} within the meaning of Section {{effective_date}} of {{party_name}} or Section 20 of {{party_name}} shall have the same rights to contribution as the {{party_name}}. The {{party_name}}’ respective obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section {{effective_date}} are several in proportion to the percentages of {{party_name}}’ Fee set forth opposite their respective names in Section 5(a) hereof and not joint. 25 (d) Remedy Not Exclusive The remedies provided for in this Section {{effective_date}} are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be available to any party at law or in equity. 13.
