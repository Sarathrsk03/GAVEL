Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the breaching {{party_name}} has a bona fide dispute as to whether such breach has occurred or has been cured, it will so notify the non- breaching {{party_name}} in writing and the cure period will be tolled until such dispute is resolved pursuant to Section 14.5.2 (Dispute Resolution). Upon a final determination of breach or failure to cure, the breaching {{party_name}} will have the remainder of the cure period to cure such breach. [***]. 13.2.2 Bankruptcy. Each {{party_name}} will have the right to terminate this {{party_name}} immediately in its entirety by giving written notice of termination to the other {{party_name}}, if the other {{party_name}} files a voluntary petition, or if an involuntary petition is granted in respect of the other {{party_name}} and appeal proceedings are not commenced within [***] ([***]) {{effective_date}}s from the date of such petition under the bankruptcy provisions of {{party_name}}, or the other {{party_name}} is declared insolvent, undergoes voluntary or involuntary dissolution, or makes an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or suffers the appointment of a receiver or trustee over all, or substantially all, of its assets or properties. All rights and licenses under or to {{party_name}} granted under or pursuant to this {{party_name}} by one {{party_name}} to the other are, and will otherwise be deemed to be, for purposes of Section 365(n) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, licenses of rights to “intellectual property” as defined under Article 101 ({{effective_date}}) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.

Each {{party_name}} will notify promptly the other in writing if it becomes aware of a Claim (actual or potential) by any Third {{party_name}} (a “Third {{party_name}} Claim”) for which indemnification may be sought by that {{party_name}} and will give such information with respect thereto as the other {{party_name}} shall reasonably request. If any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any {{party_name}} for which such {{party_name}} may seek an indemnity under Section 12.1 or {{effective_date}}, as the case may be (the “Indemnified {{party_name}}”), the Indemnified {{party_name}} shall not make any admission or statement concerning such Third {{party_name}} Claim, but shall promptly notify the other {{party_name}} (the “Indemnifying {{party_name}}”) orally and in writing and the Indemnifying {{party_name}} and Indemnified {{party_name}} shall meet to discuss how to respond to any Third {{party_name}} Claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. The Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified {{party_name}} to the extent any admission or statement made by the Indemnified {{party_name}} or any failure by such {{party_name}} to notify the Indemnifying {{party_name}} of the claim materially prejudices the defense of such claim. 12.3.2 {{party_name}} of Claim. If the Indemnifying {{party_name}} elects to defend or, if local procedural rules or laws do not permit the same, elects to control the defense of a Third {{party_name}} Claim, it shall be entitled to do so provided it gives notice to the Indemnified {{party_name}} of its intention to do so within forty-five ({{effective_date}} after the receipt of the written notice from the Indemnified {{party_name}} of the potentially indemnifiable Third {{party_name}} Claim (the “Litigation Condition”). The Indemnifying {{party_name}} expressly agrees the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall be responsible for satisfying and discharging any award made to or settlement reached with the Third {{party_name}} pursuant to the terms of this {{party_name}} without prejudice to any provision in this {{party_name}} or right at law which will allow the Indemnifying {{party_name}} subsequently to recover any amount from the Indemnified {{party_name}} to the extent the liability under such settlement or award was attributable to the Indemnified {{party_name}}. Subject to compliance with {{party_name}}, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified {{party_name}} (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed) to represent the Indemnified {{party_name}} and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, the Indemnified {{party_name}} shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified {{party_name}}. The Indemnified {{party_name}} shall not settle any claim for which it is seeking indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying {{party_name}} which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified {{party_name}} shall, if requested by the Indemnifying {{party_name}}, cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of such claim that is being managed and/or controlled by the Indemnifying {{party_name}}. The Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall not, without the written consent of the Indemnified {{party_name}} (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in which the Indemnified {{party_name}} is, or based on the same set of facts could have been, a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the Indemnified {{party_name}}, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified {{party_name}} from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If {{party_name}} is not met, then neither {{party_name}} shall have the right to control the defense of such Third {{party_name}} Claim and the Parties shall cooperate in and be consulted on the material aspects of such defense at each {{party_name}}’s own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying {{party_name}} does not satisfy {{party_name}}, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} may at any subsequent time during the pendency of the relevant Third {{party_name}} Claim irrevocably elect, if permitted by local procedural rules or laws, to defend and/or to control the defense of the relevant Third {{party_name}} Claim so long as the Indemnifying {{party_name}} also agrees to pay the reasonable fees and costs incurred by the Indemnified {{party_name}} in relation to the defense of such Third {{party_name}} Claim from 36 the inception of the Third {{party_name}} Claim until the date the Indemnifying {{party_name}} assumes the defense or control thereof. 12.4Assumption of {{party_name}}. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, an Indemnified {{party_name}} shall be entitled to assume the defense of any Third {{party_name}} Claim with respect to the Indemnified {{party_name}}, upon written notice to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} pursuant to this Section 12.4, in which case the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall be relieved of liability under Section 12.1 or {{effective_date}}, as applicable, solely for such Third {{party_name}} Claim and related Losses. 12.5Insurance. During the Term of this {{party_name}} and for a period of one ({{effective_date}} after the termination or expiration of this {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall obtain and/or maintain at its sole cost and expense, product liability insurance (including any self-insured arrangements) in amounts which are reasonable and customary in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and activities. Such product liability insurance or self-insured arrangements shall insure against all liability, including without limitation personal injury, physical injury, or property damage arising out of the manufacture, sale, distribution, or marketing of the {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} shall provide written proof of the existence of such insurance to {{party_name}} upon request.

Reimbursement will be made to {{party_name}} in United States Dollars within thirty ({{effective_date}} of receipt of the invoice by {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} will within thirty ({{effective_date}} following {{party_name}} identify the {{party_name}} representative that should receive such invoices from {{party_name}}. {{party_name}}’s obligations hereunder are in addition to any obligations of {{party_name}} under Section 13.1.2(b) 13.1.2 Prosecution and {{party_name}} Covering {{party_name}}. (a) For Patents covering {{party_name}}, the Parties shall agree, without prejudice to ownership, which {{party_name}} shall have the right to prepare and file a priority patent application, and prosecute such application(s) and maintain any patents derived therefrom, with the Parties equally sharing the reasonable out-of-pocket costs for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of such priority patent application. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to obtain any export licenses that might be required for such activities. Should the agreed upon {{party_name}} elect not to prepare and/or file any such priority patent application, it shall (i) provide the other {{party_name}} with written notice as soon as reasonably possible after making such election but in any event no later than sixty ({{effective_date}} before the other {{party_name}} would be faced with a possible loss of rights, (ii) give the other {{party_name}} the right, at the other {{party_name}}’s discretion and sole expense, to prepare and file the priority application(s), and (iii) offer reasonable assistance in connection with such preparation and filing at no cost to the other {{party_name}} except for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the agreed upon {{party_name}} in rendering such assistance. The other {{party_name}}, at its discretion and cost, shall prosecute such application(s) and maintain sole ownership of any patents derived therefrom. (b) Within nine (9) {{effective_date}} after the filing date of a priority application directed to an Invention, the {{party_name}} filing the priority application shall request that the other {{party_name}} identify those non-priority, non-{{party_name}} (“foreign”) Countries in which the other {{party_name}} desires that the {{party_name}} filing the priority application file corresponding patent applications. Within thirty ({{effective_date}} after receipt by the other {{party_name}} of such request from the {{party_name}} filing the priority application, the other {{party_name}} shall provide to the {{party_name}} filing the priority application a written list of such foreign countries in which the other {{party_name}} wishes to effect corresponding foreign patent applications filings. The Parties will then attempt to agree on the particular countries in which such applications will be filed, provided that in the event agreement is not reached, the application will be filed in the disputed as well as the non-disputed countries (all such filings referred to hereinafter as “{{party_name}}”). Thereafter, within twelve (12) {{effective_date}} after the filing date of the priority application, the {{party_name}} filing the priority application shall effect all such {{party_name}}.

Such consent is hereby given for {{party_name}} or its {{party_name}} to transfer the {{party_name}} for quality control testing performed by a third party on a blinded basis. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of a transfer of {{party_name}} to an {{party_name}} of {{party_name}} or to any third party with the consent of {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall ensure that the respective {{party_name}} or third party shall use such {{party_name}} solely to conduct the {{party_name}} in accordance with the {{party_name}} Plan, this {{party_name}}, or as otherwise may be agreed to by the Parties in writing and shall not transfer or otherwise make available, in whole or in part, the {{party_name}} to any other individual, entity or institution.

Accordingly, {{party_name}} agrees, in order to make both Parties benefit from their collaboration, that the success of the collaboration between the Parties depends strongly on the fact whether or not {{party_name}} is able to find a suitable business partner for the further development of the {{party_name}} into a successful medicinal product with one or more marketing authorisations worldwide. 2.8.2Obligations of {{party_name}} Therefore, {{party_name}} shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete at its own cost and risk a Phase 1 clinical trial with the {{party_name}} as described in Section 2.8.3 within the timelines set forth herein (subject to Section 2.8.3); and find one or more suitable third party/parties as business partner(s) for the further development of the {{party_name}} into a medicinal product (“{{party_name}}”). For the avoidance of doubt, {{party_name}} bears the sole responsibility for the conduct and completion of the clinical trials of the {{party_name}} and the search for {{party_name}} and shall bear all costs and expenses in connection therewith. In no event will it be a breach of this {{party_name}} by {{party_name}} if the Phase 1 clinical trial or other clinical trials of the {{party_name}} are not completed or an agreement is not entered into with a {{party_name}} so long as {{party_name}} uses commercially reasonable efforts to do so. 2.8.3Timelines and Information {{party_name}} shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct and complete a Phase 1 clinical trial of the {{party_name}} in a timely fashion and to search for {{party_name}}. A summary of the preliminary plan for the Phase 1 clinical trial of the {{party_name}} to be conducted by {{party_name}} is attached as Appendix 7, it being understood that timing of such clinical trial 13 may be delayed to the extent (i) caused primarily by {{party_name}}’s failure to provide {{party_name}} conforming to the {{party_name}}; or (ii) by safety issues relating to the {{party_name}}; or (iii) by regulatory delays; or (iv) other causes outside the control of {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} shall promptly provide {{party_name}} notice of the completion and a summary overview of the outcome/observations of the Phase 1 clinical trial regarding the {{party_name}} and a summary overview of any negotiations with a possible {{party_name}} regarding the further development of the {{party_name}}.
