The Parties acknowledge that at the time of execution of this {{party_name}} that the {{party_name}} and Implementation Plan may not have been fully developed, but that the creation of the {{party_name}} and development of the detailed Implementation Plan will be the first step in respect of the development and implementation of {{party_name}}, in which case, once approved by the Parties in writing, the {{party_name}} and Implementation Plan so developed will be attached hereto and shall replace {{party_name}} “1” and “2” respectively. Once finalized the {{party_name}} and Implementation Plan may not be changed or modified by either {{party_name}}, except in accordance with the procedures set out in Section 3(c). (b) Obligations Each of {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} shall perform, at their own expense (or as otherwise set out in {{party_name}} “6”), their respective obligations and responsibilities set out in the Implementation Plan as necessary to accomplish the development and implementation of {{party_name}} in accordance with the milestones and timelines set out therein. {{party_name}} acknowledges that the development and implementation of {{party_name}} requires decisions and input from {{party_name}} and for {{party_name}} to perform its obligations thereunder in a timely manner. In the event that {{party_name}} delays in providing such decisions, input or performance of its obligations, the development and implementation of {{party_name}} shall be correspondingly delayed. Subject to the foregoing, {{party_name}} acknowledges that time is of the essence with respect to its obligations hereunder and that prompt and timely performance of all such obligations, including all development and implementation dates, timetables, project milestones and other requirements in this {{party_name}} is strictly required.

The {{party_name}} Request shall include a reasonably detailed description of the scope and nature of the requested {{party_name}}. If {{party_name}} desires a {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall evaluate the feasibility of such change as it relates to the proposed Field of Use.
