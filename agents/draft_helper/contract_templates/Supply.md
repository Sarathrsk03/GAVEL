(3) A Receiving {{party_name}} may disclose and use the {{party_name}} of a {{party_name}} {{party_name}} to enforce or interpret this {{party_name}} or any other agreement with the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} in any arbitration, court or other legal proceeding.

In either circumstance, the Receiving {{party_name}} will ensure that a protective order, agreement or other mechanism is in place to preserve the confidentiality of the {{party_name}}.
