If the actual {{effective_date}} volume varies by {{amount}} ({{amount}}) from the delivered volumes for {{effective_date}}, then the Cash-out {{party_name}} will be adjusted as follows: 1. For Negative {{party_name}}s, the Cash-out {{party_name}} will be increased by the percentage variance, rounded up to the nearest whole percentage point, between the {{party_name}}) of {{party_name}} volumes and the adjusted {{party_name}}) of {{party_name}} volumes.

The {{party_name}} will repeat this allocation process until all of {{party_name}} has been allocated. Allocation will not be transferred. With agreement of the {{party_name}}s concerned, historical volume will be transferred under the following conditions: • No commercial transaction occurs between the participating shippers with regard to historical volumes. • The transfer is irrevocable. • The request to transfer must be the result of an unusual situation as may be reasonably determined by {{party_name}}. 8 Source: RANGE RESOURCES - LOUISIANA, INC., 8-K, {{effective_date}} {{party_name}} {{party_name}} OIL TARIFF F.E.R.C.

For shipments accepted for transportation to any point not named in tariffs making reference hereto which is intermediate to a point to which rates are published in said tariffs, through such unnamed point, the rate published therein to the next more distant {{party_name}} specified in the tariff will apply.
