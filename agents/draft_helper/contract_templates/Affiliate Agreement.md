EXHIBIT 4 AFFILIATE AGREEMENT ------------------- Physician {{party_name}}, Inc. {{effective_date}} {{party_name}}, Florida 32216 Attention: {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Gentlemen: The undersigned is a shareholder of {{party_name}} ("{{party_name}}"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of {{party_name}}, and will become a shareholder of Physician {{party_name}}, Inc. ("{{party_name}}"), a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Florida, pursuant to the transactions described in the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of {{effective_date}} (the "Agreement"), by and among {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} {{party_name}} ("{{party_name}}") and {{party_name}}. Under the terms of the Agreement, {{party_name}} will be merged into and with {{party_name}} (the "Merger"), and the shares of the ${{amount}} par value common stock of {{party_name}} ("{{party_name}} Common Stock") will be converted into and exchanged for shares of the ${{amount}} par value common stock of {{party_name}} ("{{party_name}} Common Stock"). This Affiliate Agreement represents an agreement between the undersigned and {{party_name}} regarding certain rights and obligations of the undersigned in connection with the shares of {{party_name}} to be received by the undersigned as a result of the Merger. In consideration of the Merger and the mutual covenants contained herein, the undersigned and {{party_name}} hereby agree as follows: 1. Affiliate {{party_name}}. The undersigned understands and agrees that as to ---------------- {{party_name}} he is an "affiliate" under {{party_name}} 145(c) as defined in {{party_name}} 405 of the {{party_name}}s and Regulations of {{party_name}} ("{{party_name}}") under the Securities Act of {{effective_date}}, as amended ("{{effective_date}} Act"), and the undersigned anticipates that he will be such an "affiliate" at the time of the Merger. 2. {{party_name}}. The undersigned agrees that he ---------------------------------- will not sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of his interests in, or reduce his risk relative to, any of the shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock into which his shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock are converted upon consummation of the Merger until such time as {{party_name}} notifies the undersigned that the requirements of {{party_name}} Accounting Series Release Nos. 130 and 135 ("ASR 130 and 135") have been met. The undersigned understands that ASR 130 and 135 relate to publication of financial results of {{party_name}} combined operations of {{party_name}} and {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} agrees that it will publish such results as promptly as practicable following the Merger in the sole discretion of {{party_name}}, but in any event within {{effective_date}} after the end of {{effective_date}} of {{party_name}} containing the required period of {{party_name}} combined operations and that it will notify the undersigned promptly following such publication. 3. Covenants and {{party_name}}. The undersigned represents, --------------------------------------- warrants and agrees that: (a) The {{party_name}} Common Stock received by the undersigned as a result of the Merger will be taken for his own account and not for others, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part. (b) {{party_name}} has informed the undersigned that any distribution by the undersigned of {{party_name}} Common Stock has not been registered under the {{effective_date}} Act and that shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock received pursuant to the Merger can only be sold by the undersigned (1) following registration under the {{effective_date}} Act, or (2) in conformity with the volume and other requirements of {{party_name}} 145(d) promulgated by the {{party_name}} as the same now exist or may hereafter be amended, or (3) to the extent some other exemption from registration under the {{effective_date}} Act might be available. The undersigned understands that {{party_name}} is under no ------------------------------------------------ obligation to file a registration statement with the {{party_name}} covering the --------------------------------------------------------------------- disposition of the undersigned's shares of {{party_name}} Common ----------------------------------------------------- Stock or to take any other action necessary to make compliance with an ---------------------------------------------------------------------- exemption from such registration available. ------------------------------------------ (c) During {{effective_date}} immediately preceding {{party_name}}, the undersigned has not sold, transfered, or otherwise disposed of his interests in, or reduced his risk relative to, any of the shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock beneficially owned by the undersigned as of the record date for determination of shareholders entitled to vote at the Shareholders' Meeting of {{party_name}} held to approve the Merger. (d) The undersigned is aware that {{party_name}} intends to treat the Merger as a tax- free reorganization under Section 368 of {{party_name}} ("Code") for federal income tax purposes. The undersigned agrees to treat the transaction in the same manner as {{party_name}} for federal income tax purposes. The undersigned acknowledges that Section 1.368-1(b) of {{party_name}} requires "continuity of interest" in order for the Merger to be treated as tax-free under Section 368 of the Code. This requirement is satisfied if, taking into account those {{party_name}} shareholders who receive cash in exchange for their stock, who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares, or who dissent from the Merger, there is no plan or intention on the part of the {{party_name}} shareholders to sell or otherwise dispose of the {{party_name}} Common Stock to be received in the Merger that will reduce such shareholders' ownership to a number of shares having, in the aggregate, a value at the time of the Merger of {{amount}} of the total fair market value of the {{party_name}} Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Merger. The undersigned has no prearrangement, plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of an amount of his {{party_name}} Common Stock to be received in the Merger which would cause the foregoing requirement not to be satisfied. 4. Restrictions on {{party_name}}. The undersigned understands and agrees that ------------------------ stop transfer instructions with respect to the shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger will be given to {{party_name}}'s transfer agent and that there will be placed on the certificates for such shares, or shares issued in substitution thereof, a legend stating in substance: "The shares represented by this certificate were issued pursuant to a business combination which is accounted for as a "pooling of interests" and may not be sold, nor may the owner thereof reduce his risks relative thereto in any way, until such time as {{party_name}}, Inc. ("{{party_name}}") has published the financial results covering {{effective_date}} of combined operations after the effective date of the merger through which the business combination was effected. In addition, the shares represented by this certificate may not be sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of except or unless (1) covered by an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of {{effective_date}}, as amended, (2) in accordance with (i) {{party_name}} 145(d) (in the case of shares issued to an individual who is not an affiliate of {{party_name}}) or (ii) {{party_name}} 144 (in the --- case of shares issued to an individual who is an affiliate of {{party_name}}) of the {{party_name}}s and Regulations of such Act, or (3) in accordance with a legal opinion satisfactory to counsel for {{party_name}} that such sale or transfer is otherwise exempt from the registration requirements of such Act." Such legend will also be placed on any certificate representing {{party_name}} securities issued subsequent to the original issuance of the {{party_name}} Common Stock pursuant to the Merger as a result of any transfer of such shares or any stock dividend, stock split, or other recapitalization as long as the {{party_name}} Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger has not been transferred in such manner to justify the removal of the legend therefrom. Upon the request of the undersigned, {{party_name}} shall cause the certificates representing the shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger to be reissued free of any legend relating to restrictions on transfer by virtue of ASR 130 and 135 as soon as practicable after the requirements of ASR 130 and 135 have been met. In addition, if the provisions of {{party_name}}s 144 and 145 are amended to eliminate restrictions applicable to the {{party_name}} Common Stock received by the undersigned pursuant to the Merger, or at the expiration of the restrictive period set forth in {{party_name}} 145(d), {{party_name}}, upon the request of the undersigned, will cause the certificates representing the shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock issued to the undersigned in connection with the Merger to be reissued free of any legend relating to the restrictions set forth in {{party_name}}s 144 and 145(d) upon receipt by {{party_name}} of an opinion of its counsel to the effect that such legend may be removed. - 2 - 5. Understanding of {{party_name}}. The undersigned has --------------------------------------------- carefully read the Agreement and this Affiliate Agreement and discussed their requirements and impact upon his ability to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock received by the undersigned, to the extent he believes necessary, with his counsel or counsel for {{party_name}}. 6. Filing of Reports by {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} agrees, for a period of {{effective_date}} ------------------------ after the effective date of the Merger, to file on a timely basis all reports required to be filed by it pursuant to Section 13 of {{party_name}} of {{effective_date}}, as amended, so that the public information provisions of {{party_name}} 145(d) promulgated by the {{party_name}} as the same are presently in effect will be available to the undersigned in the event the undersigned desires to transfer any shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock issued to the undersigned pursuant to the Merger. 7. {{party_name}} Under {{party_name}} 145(d). If the undersigned desires to sell or -------------------------- otherwise transfer the shares of {{party_name}} Common Stock received by him in connection with the Merger at any time during the restrictive period set forth in {{party_name}} 145(d), the undersigned will provide the necessary representation letter to the transfer agent for {{party_name}} Common Stock together with such additional information as the transfer agent may reasonably request. If {{party_name}}'s counsel concludes that such proposed sale or transfer complies with the requirements of {{party_name}} 145(d), {{party_name}} shall cause such counsel to provide such opinions as may be necessary to {{party_name}}'s {{party_name}} Agent so that the undersigned may complete the proposed sale or transfer. 8. Acknowledgments. The undersigned recognizes and agrees that the --------------- foregoing provisions also apply to all shares of the capital stock of {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} that are deemed to be beneficially owned by the undersigned pursuant to applicable federal securities laws, which the undersigned agrees may include, without limitation, shares owned or held in the name of (i) the undersigned's spouse, (ii) any relative of the undersigned or of the undersigned's spouse who has the same home as the undersigned, (iii) any trust or estate in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse, and any such relative collectively own at least a {{amount}} beneficial interest or of which any of the foregoing serves as trustee, executor, or in any similar capacity, and (iv) any corporation or other organization in which the undersigned, the undersigned's spouse and any such relative collectively own at least {{amount}} of any class of equity securities or of the equity interest. The undersigned further recognizes that, in the event that the undersigned is a director or officer of {{party_name}} or becomes a director or officer of {{party_name}} upon consummation of the Merger, among other things, any sale of {{party_name}} Common Stock by the undersigned within a period of {{effective_date}} following the effective time of the Merger may subject the undersigned to liability pursuant to Section 16(b) of {{party_name}} of {{effective_date}}, as amended. 9.
