[***] For the purposes of this paragraph, [***] facilities located at [***] are considered one {{party_name}}. Any facility that {{party_name}} wishes to use, other than [***] to manufacture the {{party_name}}s must be approved by Premier in writing, in advance. For the avoidance of doubt, {{party_name}}’s [***] facility must be approved by Premier before it may be used to manufacture the {{party_name}}s. Such facility approvals shall not be {{party_name}}reasonably withheld or delayed. Premier’s facility approval will be based, in part, on the successful completion of a trial production r{{party_name}} that is sufficient in meeting finished product specifications, and an evaluation of the stability and specifications of trial production product within [***] of the trial production r{{party_name}}. (b) {{party_name}} and Premier agree that all {{party_name}}s subject to this {{party_name}}, and their current and subsequently modified respective formulas are confidential and proprietary, and the sole property of Premier {{party_name}}less otherwise agreed in writing by both Parties.

During the Term of this {{party_name}}, Premier shall be required to purchase a Minimum Annual Order Volume (“MAOV”) of [***] (“Units”) for each {{effective_date}} period commencing {{effective_date}}, and for the {{effective_date}} period commencing {{effective_date}} and ending {{effective_date}}, Premier will be required to purchase [***] Units (the {{effective_date}} periods and {{effective_date}} period are each a “Contract Period”). (d) During the Term, Premier shall have the right (but not the obligation) to order from {{party_name}} quantities of {{party_name}}s in excess of [***] and provided {{party_name}} has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities of {{party_name}}s, {{party_name}} agrees to produce such additional quantities per the pricing and terms on {{party_name}}. (e) [***] (f) [***] (g) Within [***] of each calendar month during the Term, Premier shall provide to {{party_name}} a [***] rolling production forecast which shall set forth Premier’s non-binding good faith estimated purchases (each, a “{{party_name}}”) for the [***] period commencing on the date thereof (the “{{party_name}} Delivery {{amo{{party_name}}t}}”). Each {{party_name}} shall also designate which {{party_name}} shall manufacture the {{party_name}}s set forth in such {{party_name}} (i.e. {{party_name}}’s [***] {{party_name}}, {{party_name}}’s [***] {{party_name}}, or some other facility agreed to by the Parties). {{party_name}} shall notify Premier, in writing (or email), within [***] of each {{party_name}} Delivery {{amo{{party_name}}t}}, if {{party_name}}’s or {{party_name}}’s Facilities will not be able to fulfill Premier’s estimated purchases as set out in the [***] of such {{party_name}}.

(h) Within the [***] of each calendar month during the Term, {{party_name}} shall provide to Premier a [***] rolling production forecast which shall set forth {{party_name}}’s good faith estimated maximum {{effective_date}} {{party_name}}it volume (“Maximum Volume”) for each {{party_name}} during such [***] period. Modifications to the Maximum Volume shall be negotiated in good faith and agreed upon by both Parties in writing or email by the [***] of {{effective_date}}. (i) Premier shall provide {{party_name}} with {{party_name}}s (or “{{party_name}}s”) [***] in advance of the date referred to as the “Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}}” in such {{party_name}}s. The {{party_name}}s, at a minimum, will give the {{party_name}}s and quantities ordered, the Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}} requested, and designate which {{party_name}} will manufacture the {{party_name}}s. “Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}}” shall mean the production start date requested by Premier. (j) Within [***] of receipt of a {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall (i) provide to Premier email confirmation of acceptance of the {{party_name}}, a schedule of production and an estimated production completion date (the “Estimated Completion {{amo{{party_name}}t}}”), or (ii) notify Premier if any term of the {{party_name}} cannot be met. {{party_name}}’s failure to notify Premier, within the time specified herein, of an inability to meet a term of the {{party_name}} shall constitute acceptance of such {{party_name}} in its entirety. If {{party_name}} notifies Premier that it or {{party_name}} cannot meet the Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}}, the Parties shall discuss an acceptable alternate date on which production will commence (the “{{party_name}}ion {{amo{{party_name}}t}}”). Once a Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}} is accepted or a {{party_name}}ion {{amo{{party_name}}t}} is mutually agreed upon, {{party_name}} shall, or shall cause {{party_name}} to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to start production on or before the Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}} (or {{party_name}}ion {{amo{{party_name}}t}}, as applicable), but in no case more than [***] earlier or later than the Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}} (or {{party_name}}ion {{amo{{party_name}}t}}, as applicable) {{party_name}}less mutually agreed otherwise by Premier. (k) If PREMIER requests that {{party_name}}s be produced at the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} may either produce such {{party_name}}s at the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} or cause {{party_name}} to produce such {{party_name}}s at the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, in which case {{party_name}} shall be responsible for all shipping costs of transporting the {{party_name}}s to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}. If Premier requests that {{party_name}}s be produced at the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} may either cause {{party_name}} to produce such {{party_name}}s at the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} or produce such {{party_name}}s at the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, in which case {{party_name}} shall be responsible for all shipping costs of transporting the {{party_name}}s to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}. (l) If a {{party_name}} is accepted by {{party_name}} as described in Section 2(j) above but such {{party_name}} is not filled in accordance with its terms, or if {{party_name}} or {{party_name}}, as applicable, fails to complete production of the {{party_name}}s [***], Premier shall have the right to use an alternate co-packer for the {{party_name}}s specified in the {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} shall, or shall cause {{party_name}} to, provide Premier with Premier owned packaging needed to support such production by an alternate co-packer. (m) {{party_name}}s will be Premier’s best estimate of its current requirements, but may be amended up or down or canceled in their entirety by Premier to reflect changing demand for {{party_name}}s. The final Unit quantities on {{party_name}} will co{{party_name}}t towards the MAOV. However, if (i) any increase or decrease in Unit volume {{party_name}}der a particular {{party_name}} is greater than [***] of the initial {{party_name}} quantity and (ii) Premier requests such change or cancellation within the [***] period prior to the Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}} (or {{party_name}}ion {{amo{{party_name}}t}}, as applicable) (the “[***] Period”), {{party_name}} in its sole discretion, may charge Premier [***]. In no event shall Premier pay [***] if (i) it cancels or modifies any {{party_name}} prior to the commencement of the [***] Period (i.e.; prior to the commencement of the [***] period preceding the Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}} (or {{party_name}}ion {{amo{{party_name}}t}}, as applicable), (ii) {{party_name}} or {{party_name}} fails to timely start production in the [***] period before or after the Due {{amo{{party_name}}t}} (or {{party_name}}ion {{amo{{party_name}}t}}, as applicable), or (iii) the basis for Premier’s cancellation is a breach by {{party_name}} of its obligations, representations or warranties here{{party_name}}der. 3 Source: BELLRING BRANDS, INC., S-1, {{effective_date}} (n) {{party_name}} shall within [***] after the end of the production r{{party_name}}, notify Premier via email of the final estimated production quantity and the estimated quantity, including losses, of all Premier-supplied materials used.

(a) Initial {{party_name}}. On {{effective_date}}{{effective_date}} basis, {{party_name}} shall purchase each {{party_name}} from {{party_name}} at the {{party_name}} for such {{party_name}} for such {{effective_date}}, as determined in accordance with the terms of this Section 3. The {{party_name}} for each {{party_name}} during the Initial {{party_name}} Term (such {{party_name}}, the “Initial {{party_name}}” for such {{party_name}}) is set forth in the {{party_name}} Addendum for such {{party_name}}. Following the Initial {{party_name}} Term, the {{party_name}} of such {{party_name}} may be adjusted only as set forth in Section 3.1(b) and Section 3.2. (b) {{party_name}} in Extension Periods. In the event that {{party_name}} elects to extend {{party_name}} a {{party_name}} Addendum, the {{party_name}} for each applicable {{party_name}} in any Extension Period shall be {{amount}} ({{amount}}) of {{party_name}}’s Standard {{party_name}} Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent ({{amount}}) of {{party_name}}’s Standard {{party_name}} of such {{party_name}}, each for the initial {{effective_date}} of the first Extension Period with respect to such {{party_name}}. During each Extension Period, the {{party_name}} of such {{party_name}} may be adjusted as set forth in Section 3.2; provided that the initial {{effective_date}} of the first Extension Period shall operate as the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Baseline {{effective_date}} (as defined below). -26- Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} (c) Subject to the limitations and conditions set forth in this {{party_name}}, it is the intention of the Parties that the {{party_name}} of each {{party_name}} reflects {{amount}} ({{amount}}) of {{party_name}}’s Standard {{party_name}} Materials Cost plus one hundred and ten percent ({{amount}}) of {{party_name}}’s Standard {{party_name}} of such {{party_name}}. The {{party_name}} for each {{party_name}} will be set forth in the currency specified in the applicable {{party_name}} Addendum. (d) Changes to the {{party_name}} Methodology. {{party_name}} shall have the right to change the {{party_name}} methodology once per {{effective_date}}; provided that any change shall be consistent with {{party_name}} and applied across all products manufactured at the applicable {{party_name}}. If {{party_name}} elects to change the {{party_name}} methodology, {{party_name}} shall calculate both (i) the revised {{party_name}} using the methodology effective during the then-current {{effective_date}} of the Term of the applicable {{party_name}} Addendum and (ii) the percentage change in {{party_name}} caused by the change in methodology relative to the former methodology. If such {{party_name}} methodology change results in an increase of {{party_name}} {{party_name}} for {{party_name}}s manufactured for {{party_name}} of {{amount}} ({{amount}}), then {{party_name}} shall revert to the former methodology for purposes of the calculation of {{party_name}} during such {{effective_date}}. 3.2 {{party_name}} Adjustment. (a) {{party_name}} Materials Adjustment. (i) On a {{party_name}}-by-{{party_name}} basis, with respect to each full {{effective_date}} of the Term of the applicable {{party_name}} Addendum, the {{party_name}} of each {{party_name}} manufactured at the applicable {{party_name}} will be updated to reflect {{amount}} ({{amount}}) of the full estimated amount of the increase or decrease in the cost of {{party_name}} Materials for each such {{party_name}}. (ii) In each {{effective_date}} of {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall submit a report to {{party_name}} by no later than the end of the first quarter of such {{effective_date}} setting out the {{party_name}} Actual {{party_name}} Materials Cost with respect to each {{party_name}} for the prior {{effective_date}}. In the event that the {{party_name}} Actual {{party_name}} Materials Cost differs from the {{party_name}} Estimated {{party_name}} Materials Cost, when adjusted to reflect actual volume, then {{party_name}} shall issue either (A) an invoice to {{party_name}} for any amounts owed by {{party_name}} to {{party_name}} or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by {{party_name}} to {{party_name}} reflecting the difference between the {{party_name}} as invoiced and an adjusted {{party_name}} for such {{effective_date}}; -27- Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} provided, however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of Section 3.2(e). {{party_name}} shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable {{party_name}} Addendum within sixty (60) calendar {{effective_date}} from the date of the invoice. If {{party_name}} disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event {{party_name}} shall notify {{party_name}} of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by {{party_name}} of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of {{party_name}}’s rights under this {{party_name}}. (b) {{party_name}}. (i) Subject to the remainder of this Section 3.2(b), on a {{party_name}}-by-{{party_name}} basis, if the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s of a {{party_name}} during any {{effective_date}} following the first full {{effective_date}} of the Term of the applicable {{party_name}} Addendum (such {{effective_date}}, a “{{party_name}} {{party_name}} Adjustment {{effective_date}}”) are estimated to be (a) less than seventy-five percent ({{amount}}) of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s for the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Baseline {{effective_date}} (as defined below) or (b) greater than one hundred and twenty-five percent ({{amount}}) of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s for the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Baseline {{effective_date}} (clauses (a) and (b) referred to collectively as the “{{party_name}} {{party_name}} Threshold”), when adjusted to reflect a constant volume between the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Adjustment {{effective_date}} and the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Baseline {{effective_date}}, then the {{party_name}} for such {{party_name}} will be updated beginning with such {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Adjustment {{effective_date}} to reflect one hundred and ten percent ({{amount}}) of the increase or decrease in {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s. An example calculation of the foregoing {{party_name}} adjustment is attached hereto as {{party_name}} to the last sentence of Section 3.1(b), the “{{party_name}} {{party_name}} Baseline {{effective_date}}” shall be, as of {{party_name}}, {{effective_date}} budget volumes and costs as summarized in the applicable {{party_name}} Addenda; provided that in each instance in which the {{party_name}} is adjusted in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 3.2(b)(i), the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Baseline {{effective_date}} shall be the applicable {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Adjustment {{effective_date}}. (ii) In the event that {{party_name}} is adjusted as a result of a change to {{party_name}} {{party_name}} under Section 3.2(b)(i), the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Threshold for all remaining {{effective_date}}s in {{party_name}} (or Extension Periods as appropriate) will be reduced such that if {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s of a {{party_name}} during any {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Adjustment {{effective_date}} are estimated to be (a) less -28- Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} than eighty percent ({{amount}}) of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s for the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Baseline {{effective_date}} or (b) greater than one hundred and twenty percent ({{amount}}) of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s for the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Baseline {{effective_date}}, then the {{party_name}} for such {{party_name}} will be updated beginning with such {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Adjustment {{effective_date}} to reflect the full estimated amount of the increase or decrease in {{party_name}}. (iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2(b), {{party_name}} shall not have the ability to adjust the {{party_name}} to reflect actual volume for {{party_name}}s in a {{party_name}} to the extent that {{party_name}} has reduced its demand for one or more {{party_name}}s in such {{party_name}} due to {{party_name}}’s breach of or other failure to supply under this {{party_name}} or the applicable {{party_name}} Addendum. (iv) In each {{effective_date}} following the first full {{effective_date}} of {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall submit a report to {{party_name}} by no later than the end of the first quarter of such {{effective_date}} setting out the actual volume of {{party_name}} for each {{party_name}} for the prior {{effective_date}}. In the event that the actual {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s demonstrate that the then applicable {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Threshold has been exceeded, and {{party_name}} had not previously adjusted the applicable {{party_name}} in accordance with this Section 3.2(b) to account for such adjustment, then {{party_name}} shall either issue (A) an invoice to {{party_name}} for any amounts owed by {{party_name}} to {{party_name}} or (B) a credit memo for amounts owed by {{party_name}} to {{party_name}} reflecting the difference between the {{party_name}} as invoiced and the adjusted {{party_name}} for such {{effective_date}}; provided, however, that any such adjustment made in accordance with the foregoing shall be subject in all cases to the provisions of Section 3.2(b)(iii). For clarity, any amount owed by {{party_name}} to {{party_name}} or owed by {{party_name}} to {{party_name}} shall be one hundred and ten percent ({{amount}}) of {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}}, reduced by a {{amount}} allowance for variable costs. {{party_name}} shall pay all undisputed amounts due in the currency specified in the applicable {{party_name}} Addendum within sixty (60) calendar {{effective_date}} from the date of the invoice. If {{party_name}} disputes all or any portion of an invoice, it shall be required to pay only the amount not in dispute, and in such event {{party_name}} shall notify {{party_name}} of the amount and nature of the dispute. Payment by {{party_name}} of any amount reflected in any invoice shall not result in a waiver of any of {{party_name}}’s rights under this {{party_name}}. (c) Notwithstanding the above, the price for {{party_name}} will be updated {{effective_date}} in {{effective_date}} following the first {{effective_date}} to reflect {{amount}} ({{amount}}) of the full estimated amount of the cost of {{party_name}} to {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} may not change the price of {{party_name}} -29- Source: {{party_name}}, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} materials during any {{effective_date}}. Upon any notification by {{party_name}} to {{party_name}} of any reduction in the price of {{party_name}} for the upcoming {{effective_date}}, {{party_name}} shall submit to {{party_name}} an inventory of such {{party_name}} on hand and a calculation of the positive difference between the aggregate price for such {{party_name}} applying the price for the current {{effective_date}} and the aggregate price for such {{party_name}} applying the price for the upcoming {{effective_date}}. {{party_name}} shall promptly and in no event later than sixty (60) {{effective_date}} issue to {{party_name}} a credit memo in the amount of such positive difference reflected in {{party_name}}’s notice. (d) The increases or decreases described in this Section 3.2 shall be determined by {{party_name}} in a manner consistent with the accounting methodologies used by {{party_name}} as of {{party_name}} and shall be based on the applicable {{party_name}}s provided by {{party_name}} in {{effective_date}} of the applicable {{effective_date}} and applied consistently across {{party_name}}’s entire manufacturing operations for the full {{party_name}}. (e) {{party_name}} shall notify {{party_name}} of any estimated expected changes to {{party_name}}s for the upcoming {{effective_date}} by {{effective_date}} of the then-current {{effective_date}} and shall notify {{party_name}} of any actual changes to {{party_name}}s for the upcoming {{effective_date}} by {{effective_date}} of the then-current {{effective_date}}. {{effective_date}} and {{effective_date}}, the Parties will engage in ongoing discussions to ensure that any final changes to {{party_name}}s for the applicable {{effective_date}} conform to the terms and conditions of this {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} will promptly respond to {{party_name}}’s inquiries regarding any proposed changes to the {{party_name}} of {{party_name}}s and provide reasonable documentation to {{party_name}} supporting the estimated or actual change in such {{party_name}}s. Any actual, adjusted {{party_name}} of each {{party_name}} shall become effective on {{effective_date}} of such upcoming {{effective_date}}.

(b) An Indemnifying {{party_name}} may elect (but shall not be required) to defend (and seek to settle or compromise), at such Indemnifying {{party_name}}’s own expense and by such Indemnifying {{party_name}}’s own counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the {{party_name}}), any Third-{{party_name}} Claim; provided that the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall not be entitled to defend such Third-{{party_name}} Claim and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate -60- Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} counsel for all {{party_name}}s if the claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any criminal action, indictment or allegation or if such Third-{{party_name}} Claim seeks an injunction or equitable relief against the {{party_name}} (and not any Indemnifying {{party_name}} or any of its {{party_name}}). Within thirty ({{effective_date}} after the receipt of notice from an {{party_name}} in accordance with Section 10.3(a) (or sooner, if the nature of such Third-{{party_name}} Claim so requires), the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall notify the {{party_name}} of its election whether the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will assume responsibility for defending such Third-{{party_name}} Claim, which election shall specify any reservations or exceptions to its defense. After notice from an Indemnifying {{party_name}} to an {{party_name}} of its election to assume the defense of a Third-{{party_name}} Claim, such {{party_name}} shall have the right to employ separate counsel and to participate in (but not control) the defense, compromise, or settlement thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be the expense of such {{party_name}}; provided, however, in the event that the Indemnifying {{party_name}} has elected to assume the defense of the Third-{{party_name}} Claim but has specified, and continues to assert, any reservations or exceptions in such notice, then, in such case, the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel for all {{party_name}}s shall be borne by the Indemnifying {{party_name}}; and provided further that the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel if, based on the reasonable opinion of legal counsel to the {{party_name}}, a conflict or potential conflict of interest exists between the Indemnifying {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} which makes representation of both parties inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct. (c) If an Indemnifying {{party_name}} elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-{{party_name}} Claim, or fails to notify an {{party_name}} of its election as provided in {{effective_date}}), then the applicable {{party_name}} may defend such Third-{{party_name}} Claim at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying {{party_name}} to the extent indemnification is available under the terms of this {{party_name}}. If an Indemnifying {{party_name}} elects not to assume responsibility for defending a Third-{{party_name}} Claim, or fails to notify an {{party_name}} of its election as provided in {{effective_date}}), then, it shall not be a defense to any obligation of the Indemnifying {{party_name}} to pay any amount in respect of such Third-{{party_name}} Claim that the Indemnifying {{party_name}} was not consulted in the defense thereof, that such Indemnifying {{party_name}}’s views or opinions as to the conduct of such defense were not accepted or adopted, that such Indemnifying {{party_name}} does not approve of the quality or manner of the defense thereof or, subject to Section 10.3(d), that such Third-{{party_name}} Claim was incurred by reason of a settlement rather than by a judgment or other determination of liability. (d) Neither {{party_name}} may settle or compromise any Third-{{party_name}} Claim for which either {{party_name}} is seeking to be indemnified hereunder without the prior written consent of the other {{party_name}}, which consent may not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, unless such settlement or compromise is solely for monetary damages that are fully payable by the settling or compromising party, does not involve any admission, finding or determination of wrongdoing or violation of {{party_name}} by the other {{party_name}} and provides for a full, unconditional and irrevocable release of the other {{party_name}} from all {{party_name}} in connection with the Third-{{party_name}} Claim. -61- Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 10.4 Limitations on {{party_name}}.

Accordingly, the amount that any Indemnifying {{party_name}} is required to pay to any {{party_name}} will be reduced by any {{party_name}} or other amounts actually recovered (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) from any {{party_name}} by or on behalf of such {{party_name}} in respect of the related {{party_name}}. If an {{party_name}} receives a payment (an “Indemnity Payment”) required by this {{party_name}} from an Indemnifying {{party_name}} in respect of any {{party_name}} and subsequently receives {{party_name}} or any other amounts in respect of the related {{party_name}}, then the {{party_name}} will pay to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} an amount equal to the excess of the Indemnity Payment received over the amount of the Indemnity Payment that would have been due if the {{party_name}} or such other amounts (net of any out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred in the collection thereof) had been received, realized or recovered before the Indemnity Payment was made. (b) An insurer that would otherwise be obligated to pay any claim shall not be relieved of the responsibility with respect thereto or, solely by virtue of any provisions contained in this {{party_name}}, have any subrogation rights with respect thereto, it being expressly understood and agreed that no insurer or any other Third {{party_name}} shall be entitled to a “wind-fall” (i.e., a benefit that such insurer or other Third {{party_name}} would not be entitled to receive in the absence of the indemnification provisions) by virtue of the indemnification provisions hereof. Each {{party_name}} shall, and shall cause the members of its {{party_name}} to, use commercially reasonable efforts (taking into account the probability of success on the merits and the cost of expending such efforts, including attorneys’ fees and expenses) to collect or recover any {{party_name}} that may be collectible or recoverable respecting the Liabilities for which indemnification may be available under this Section 10. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnifying {{party_name}} may not delay making any indemnification payment required under the terms of this {{party_name}}, or otherwise satisfying any indemnification obligation, pending the outcome of any Action to collect or recover {{party_name}}, and an {{party_name}} need not attempt to collect any {{party_name}} prior to making a claim for indemnification or receiving any Indemnity Payment otherwise owed to it under this {{party_name}} or any Ancillary {{party_name}}. -63- Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 10.6 Additional Matters.

(c) If payment is made by or on behalf of any Indemnifying {{party_name}} to any {{party_name}} in connection with any Third-{{party_name}} Claim, such Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall be subrogated to and shall stand in the place of such {{party_name}} as to any events or circumstances in respect of which such {{party_name}} may have any right, defense or claim relating to such Third-{{party_name}} Claim against any claimant or plaintiff asserting such Third-{{party_name}} Claim or against any other {{party_name}}. Such {{party_name}} shall cooperate with such Indemnifying {{party_name}} in a reasonable manner, and at the cost and expense of such Indemnifying {{party_name}}, in prosecuting any subrogated right, defense or claim. (d) In the event of an Action in which the Indemnifying {{party_name}} is not a named defendant, if either the {{party_name}} or Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall so request, the Parties shall endeavor to substitute the Indemnifying {{party_name}} for the named defendant or otherwise add the Indemnifying {{party_name}} as party thereto, if at all practicable. If such substitution or addition cannot be achieved for any reason or is not requested, the named defendant shall allow the Indemnifying {{party_name}} to manage the Action as set forth in this Section 10, and the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall fully indemnify the named defendant against all costs of defending the Action (including court costs, sanctions imposed by a court, attorneys’ fees, experts fees and all other external expenses), the costs of any judgment or settlement, and the cost of any interest or penalties relating to any judgment or settlement with respect to such Third-{{party_name}} Claim. -64- Source: UPJOHN INC, 10-12G, {{effective_date}} 11.
