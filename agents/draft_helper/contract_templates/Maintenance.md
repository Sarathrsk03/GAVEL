If arbitration is invoked under Section 4.8(b), all arbitrators shall be qualified by education, training, and experience in both the intellectual property law (e.g., patent law) and the technology relevant to any dispute under this Section. Throughout the course of attempting to resolve the dispute, {{party_name}} shall continue to pay {{party_name}}’s Minimum Share to {{party_name}} as such payments become due. When {{party_name}} is finally determined (either through escalation or arbitration, as the case may be) (“Determined {{party_name}}”), there shall be a true-up and {{party_name}} shall promptly pay to {{party_name}} the aggregate amount of past underpayments (i.e., the difference between monies previously due computed at the Determined {{party_name}}, minus those amounts that {{party_name}} had actually paid to {{party_name}}), if any.
