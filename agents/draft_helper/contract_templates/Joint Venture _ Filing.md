A {{party_name}} {{party_name}} shall be calculated pursuant to United States and/or United Kingdom law and regulations (and the laws and regulations of any other jurisdiction under which the earnings of {{party_name}} may be taxable to either {{party_name}}) as may be applicable to either {{party_name}}. The tax liability shall be calculated based on each {{party_name}}'s share of the income, gain, costs, expenses and deductions of {{party_name}} in {{effective_date}} without consideration of items of income, gain, loss or deduction applicable to either {{party_name}} derived from outside {{party_name}} (including, without limitation, with respect to {{party_name}}, any Net Operating Loss that {{party_name}} may have accumulated prior to the formation of {{party_name}}), but shall include any items of income, gain, loss or deduction derived from {{party_name}} in {{effective_date}} to the extent applicable to {{effective_date}}. Such {{party_name}} {{party_name}} shall not be deemed to be final until it is approved by the {{party_name}}; provided, that if the {{party_name}} does not approve the higher {{party_name}}, and cannot resolve such a dispute within {{effective_date}} of the submission of such {{party_name}} to the {{party_name}}, then the lesser {{party_name}} (the "Preliminary Minimum Distribution") shall be paid to both Parties pursuant to Article 6.2 as if it were the Minimum Distribution. After the expiration of such {{effective_date}} period, the {{party_name}} shall promptly submit the higher {{party_name}} (the "Disputed Estimate") to {{party_name}} (the "{{party_name}} Auditor") who shall evaluate the reasonableness and accuracy of {{party_name}} in light of the provisions of this Article 6.{{amount}}. The {{party_name}} that submitted {{party_name}} shall promptly provide to the {{party_name}} Auditor all information requested by the {{party_name}} Auditor in order to perform the analysis required by this Article 6.{{amount}}. Within {{effective_date}} of receiving all information it deems necessary to perform the analysis required herein, the {{party_name}} Auditor shall inform the {{party_name}} in writing that it either agrees or disagrees that {{party_name}} is reasonable and accurate in light of the provisions of this Article 6.{{amount}} and the tax information submitted to it. If the {{party_name}} Auditor concludes that {{party_name}} is reasonable and accurate, the difference between {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} shall be promptly paid to each {{party_name}}. If the {{party_name}} Auditor concludes that {{party_name}} is not reasonable and/or accurate then {{party_name}} shall be deemed the Minimum Distribution for the applicable year; provided, however, that if the {{party_name}} Auditor concludes that an amount greater than {{party_name}} is appropriate, then such greater amount shall be deemed the Minimum Distribution for the applicable year. The costs of the {{party_name}} Auditor shall be paid equally by the Parties. 6.2. Subject to the provisions of Article 6.{{amount}}, {{party_name}} shall {{effective_date}}ly declare and pay by March {{amount}}5 a distribution to each {{party_name}} equal to the larger of the two estimated {{effective_date}} tax liabilities as reflected on the approved {{party_name}} {{party_name}}s (the "Minimum Distribution"). A portion of the Minimum Distribution shall be paid in advance on a {{effective_date}} basis should either {{party_name}} be required to pay periodic mandatory payments of estimated taxes during {{effective_date}}. In the event that such estimated taxes are required to be paid by either {{party_name}}, such {{party_name}} shall notify {{party_name}} of the date of such required payments and {{party_name}} shall pay to each {{party_name}}, no later than 5 business days prior to the due date of each {{effective_date}} estimated tax payment specified in the notice above, an amount equal to {{amount}} of the estimated Minimum Distribution. In the event that such distributions of estimate taxes are made within {{effective_date}}, then the distribution on March {{amount}}5 of the subsequent year shall be adjusted to reflect the advance distributions of related estimated taxes made prior to that date. 6.3. The {{party_name}} shall {{effective_date}}ly within {{effective_date}} after the end of each fiscal year declare an additional distribution equal to {{amount}} of the net income of {{party_name}}, half of which is to be paid to each {{party_name}} (the "Target Distribution"). The Target Distribution shall be paid except when the {{party_name}} shall determine otherwise. 6.4. The {{party_name}} may pay other distributions at its discretion. 6.5. Notwithstanding the foregoing, {{party_name}} shall only pay distributions or dividends to the extent permitted by applicable law. 7. PARTIES' WITHDRAWAL FROM THE FIELD OF AGREEMENT. 7.{{amount}}. Each {{party_name}} shall, and shall cause each of its {{party_name}} to, do all such things and shall take all such steps as are reasonably necessary to effect its total withdrawal from the Field of Agreement. Such withdrawal shall be effective from {{party_name}}. 7.2. After {{party_name}} and as long as {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} continue to own an interest in {{party_name}}, neither of the Parties shall, or shall cause or permit any of their {{party_name}} to, directly or indirectly, as stockholders, consultants, members, partners or in any other capacity, engage in any enterprise or business anywhere in the world, which (a) manufactures {{party_name}} or (b) develops, markets, or sells products falling within the Field of Agreement. In the event that either (x) one {{party_name}} shall transfer its entire interest in {{party_name}} as permitted pursuant to this Agreement and {{party_name}} shall remain a going concern after the closing of such transfer or (y) both Parties sell their interest in {{party_name}} as permitted pursuant to this Agreement and {{party_name}} shall remain a going concern after the closing of such transfer, then any {{party_name}} which ceases to own an interest in {{party_name}} as a result of such transfer shall remain subject to the terms of this Article 7.2 for a period of ten ({{amount}}0) {{effective_date}} after the date of such transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the obligations set forth in this Article 7.2 are unreasonable in scope, time or geography, such court is hereby authorized by the Parties to enforce such provisions with narrower scope, shorter time or lesser geography as such court determines to be the maximum that is reasonable and proper in the circumstances. 7.3. Except as set forth in Articles 7.{{amount}}, 7.2, 8.{{amount}} and 8.2, it is explicitly agreed that nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent either {{party_name}} or any of their respective {{party_name}} from engaging, directly or indirectly, in any enterprise, which develops, manufactures, markets, or sells products that are not within the Field of Agreement, and except as set forth in Articles 7.{{amount}}, 7.2, 8.{{amount}} and 8.2, either {{party_name}} shall be free to engage in any business, enterprise, or undertaking, or to make any investment it chooses. 8. {{party_name}} AND DEVELOPMENTS. 8.{{amount}}. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as either {{party_name}} is a partner, member, or shareholder of {{party_name}}, such {{party_name}} or any of its {{party_name}} receives or discovers any opportunity within the Field of Agreement, including without limitation developing or completing the development of, or discovering, or acquiring proprietary rights over, a product or process that falls within the Field of Agreement, {{party_name}} then shall have exclusive rights to exploit such opportunity, but only within the Field of Agreement. The {{party_name}} (or its {{party_name}}) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process will, however, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process for application outside the Field of Agreement. 8.2. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as either {{party_name}} is a partner, member, or shareholder of {{party_name}}, such {{party_name}} or any of its {{party_name}} receives or discovers any opportunity to use {{party_name}} as a {{party_name}} (a "{{party_name}} Opportunity"), including without limitation developing or completing the development of, or discovering, or acquiring proprietary rights over, a product or process that involves the use of {{party_name}} as a {{party_name}}, such {{party_name}} shall (or shall cause its {{party_name}} to) present such opportunity to {{party_name}}, providing {{party_name}} with such narrative description and budgetary and other information as such {{party_name}} (or its {{party_name}}) may have generated or gathered to the extent necessary to evaluate such {{party_name}} Opportunity. The {{party_name}} shall consider the material presented by such {{party_name}} and its {{party_name}} and shall elect whether {{party_name}} should pursue such {{party_name}} Opportunity. If the {{party_name}} elects to pursue such {{party_name}} Opportunity, {{party_name}} then shall have exclusive rights to exploit such {{party_name}} Opportunity, but solely with respect to use of {{party_name}} as a {{party_name}}, and, subject to Article 8.{{amount}}, the {{party_name}} (or its {{party_name}}) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process will, however, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process for application outside of use of {{party_name}} as a {{party_name}}. If however the {{party_name}} does not elect to pursue such {{party_name}} Opportunity, the {{party_name}} (or its {{party_name}}) that has developed, discovered or acquired such opportunity, product or process shall, subject to Article 8.{{amount}}, be entitled to exploit such opportunity, product or process; provided, that subsequent developments or discoveries with respect to such {{party_name}} Opportunity would reasonably be expected to affect the {{party_name}}'s acceptance or rejection of such {{party_name}} Opportunity, such {{party_name}} shall (or shall cause its {{party_name}} to) present such {{party_name}} Opportunity to the {{party_name}} with reference to the pertinent subsequent developments or discoveries. 8.3. If, after the date of this Agreement and continuing as long as a {{party_name}} is a partner, member, or shareholder of {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} develops or completes the development of, or discovers, or acquires proprietary rights over, a process or product which at, or after, the time of its development, discovery or acquisition has, or might have, some application outside of the Field of Agreement, then the appropriate entity of {{party_name}} shall offer to license the use of the process or product (or the production thereof) for such application to each of the Parties on reasonable commercial terms (including, without limitation, the possible payment of royalties at market rates) taking into account the time and money spent by {{party_name}} and taking into account other relevant commercial factors.
