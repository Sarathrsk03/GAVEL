The {{party_name}} will regularly report amounts paid, if any, to the Consultant by filing Form 1099-MISC and/or other appropriate form with {{party_name}} as required by law.

The Consultant agrees to accept exclusive liability for complying with all applicable state and federal laws governing self-employed individuals, including obligations such as payment of taxes, social security, disability and other contributions based on fees paid to the Consultant under this {{party_name}}.
