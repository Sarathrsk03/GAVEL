To create a new iOS / Android Native app and a web responsive site to allow users to connect with each other inside a unique social betting platform. The {{party_name}} is social trivia, initially sports trivia and other trivia contests leading to peer to peer betting intended for the causal and non- professional betting market. A landing page to promote the product is included as well for desktop and mobile devices. Developer will publish the app in {{party_name}} with developer accounts registered to the client. The responsive website will be uploaded and deployed into an {{party_name}} Environment also registered to the client. The applications and responsive website will be fed by a Ruby on Rails backend with the according {{party_name}}. The {{party_name}} will be open to be used in other sports betting platforms.

Our games will initially be quick to play quiz type games that allows the user to get involved in around 20 seconds, and then receive results from push notifications. Game types are set up dynamically with live game shows with Hosts 2 – 4 times per month. Because the format doesn’t change, we can run games nightly for {{party_name}} to {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} to individual events such as the {{party_name}}, other awards shows, and new sporting events such as {{party_name}} and {{party_name}}. Games and events automated from the backend and launched automatically. {{party_name}} plugged in to track results in real time, and there is a manual option to allow customs events that can be run through the platform. Business model- What sets our platform apart from other platforms in this untapped casual industry is that we have winners win significant amounts of money via time breakers, timing of inputting answers etc. Competitor platforms pay out an average of {{amount}}. Our winners are more top loaded and pay out {{amount}} per the top 5 and ${{amount}} per the top 10. Initially monetization is based upon sponsors paying out the pots. IE, a pot for a single game will be {{amount}} to the winners and {{party_name}} will pay {{amount}} to sponsor the event. In return they will get around {{amount}}-75,000 unique user hits and eyeballs to their product/company. 8 │ Page Source: CLICKSTREAM CORP, 1-A, 3/30/{{effective_date}} Eventually the platform will expand into affiliate sales of products and once the audience has grown large enough, peer to peer betting. Monetization We will initially fund {{effective_date}} of pots in order to attract enough users to get sponsors. After {{effective_date}} we will have enough users to begin having sponsors pay the pots. We will then expand to peer to peer betting and advertising. B. SERVICES.

ARTICLE 4 - DI{{party_name}}LOSURE, {{party_name}} AND RESTRICTED USE 4.01 {{party_name}} Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction. {{party_name}} will promptly disclose to {{party_name}}, in written or other tangible form, any and all {{party_name}} Information including any {{party_name}} Inventions. Except as otherwise permitted under this {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} agrees to hold {{party_name}} Information in confidence, and not to disclose or make it available to any third party without the express prior written consent of {{party_name}}, for a period commencing on {{party_name}} and ending twenty ({{effective_date}} thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} agrees to use and practice {{party_name}} Information only for the {{party_name}} or as authorized in Article 7 (License to {{party_name}} Results). 4.02 {{party_name}} Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction. Each {{party_name}} will make available its {{party_name}} to the other {{party_name}} that it believes will be useful in carrying out work under the {{party_name}}. Except as otherwise permitted under this {{party_name}}, each {{party_name}} agrees to hold the {{party_name}} it receives from the other {{party_name}} in confidence, and to not disclose or make available the other {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} to any third party without the express prior written consent of the other {{party_name}}, for a period commencing on {{party_name}} and ending twenty ({{effective_date}} thereafter. Without the express prior written consent of the other {{party_name}}, each {{party_name}} agrees to use and practice the other {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} only for the {{party_name}} or as authorized in Article 8 (License to {{party_name}} and Patents). 4.03 {{party_name}} {{party_name}}. Except as otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing, each {{party_name}} agrees not to determine or have determined the composition or physical structure of any Background Sample received from the other {{party_name}}, which includes unused, used and spent {{party_name}} or portions thereof, whether by analyzing, having analyzed, inspection, reverse engineering or otherwise. 4.04 Information Handling Obligations. Each {{party_name}} will endeavor to mark {{party_name}} as follows: (a) {{party_name}} first disclosed in tangible form or electronically will be marked by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} as “confidential” or “proprietary” or with words of similar import when provided, indicating whether the information is “{{party_name}} Information” or “{{party_name}}”; (b) {{party_name}} first disclosed orally or by visual display will be identified by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} as “confidential” or “proprietary” or with words of similar import at first disclosure and subsequently confirmed as confidential in a summary provided in an e-mail or other written communication delivered to the other {{party_name}} within thirty ({{effective_date}} after first disclosure, that references the date of the confidential disclosure indicating whether the information is “{{party_name}} Information” or “{{party_name}}”; and (c) If a Sample is sent to the other {{party_name}}, the Sample will be marked by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} as “confidential” or “proprietary” or with words of similar import at the time of disclosure indicating whether the Sample is “{{party_name}} Information” or “{{party_name}}”. Page 3 of 31 Source: {{party_name}}, 8-K, {{effective_date}} The failure to appropriately mark information/materials as “confidential” or “proprietary” upon initial disclosure to the Receiving {{party_name}} will not be considered a waiver of confidentiality. Information/materials marked as “proprietary” or “confidential” when first disclosed, without further identification of the category of confidential information, will be presumptively considered and treated as {{party_name}} Information until the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} notifies the Receiving {{party_name}} otherwise in writing. 4.05 Exceptions. For the purposes of this {{party_name}}, the obligations of confidentiality and restricted use herein shall not apply to any information or materials to the extent the Receiving {{party_name}} can establish by documentary evidence that one or more of the following exceptions apply: a. the information or material was already in the Receiving {{party_name}}’s or its {{party_name}}’s lawful possession (free of any confidentiality and use restrictions) and was not previously acquired directly or indirectly from the other {{party_name}} under a current obligation of confidentiality; b. the information or material was already in the public domain or subsequently entered the public domain after disclosure through no fault of the Receiving {{party_name}}; c. the information or material was or is hereafter furnished to the Receiving {{party_name}}, or its {{party_name}}, on a non- confidential basis by a third party legally entitled to provide the information or material without restriction; d. the information or material was independently developed by employees or agents of the Receiving {{party_name}} or its {{party_name}} who did not have access to relevant information provided by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}; {{party_name}} information or material was released from the confidentiality obligations of this {{party_name}} by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}’s written authorization. The later occurrence of any one of the aforementioned exceptions will not excuse any failure to adequately protect {{party_name}} pursuant to this {{party_name}} prior to the existence of the exception. More specific {{party_name}} will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because it is embraced by more general information that is publicly available or in the possession of Receiving {{party_name}} pursuant to one of the exceptions. Also a combination of features will not be deemed within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are publicly available or in Receiving {{party_name}}’s possession pursuant to one of the exceptions. 4.06 Disclosure to {{party_name}}s, Contractors, and Sub-licensees. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this {{party_name}}, a Receiving {{party_name}} may disclose a {{party_name}} {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} to its {{party_name}}s, and said Receiving {{party_name}} may disclose the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} to their respective contractors providing services in furtherance of a {{party_name}} as well as to permitted sub-licensees hereunder, provided such {{party_name}}s, contractors, and sub-licensees have agreed to be bound by confidentiality and limited use obligations no less protective of {{party_name}} {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} than the terms contained herein. The Receiving {{party_name}} will be liable to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} for any unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} by such {{party_name}}s, contractors, and sub-licensees. 4.07 Compelled Disclosure. In the event that a Receiving {{party_name}} (or its {{party_name}}) is required by law, court order or rule, or government authority to disclose the {{party_name}} that Receiving {{party_name}} is obligated to hold in confidence pursuant to {{party_name}} ({{party_name}} Information Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction) and/or {{party_name}} 4.02 ({{party_name}} Disclosure, Confidentiality and Use Restriction), then the Receiving {{party_name}} will promptly notify the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} prior to disclosure in order to enable the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} to seek a protective order at the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}’s sole expense. In any event, the Receiving {{party_name}} who is required to disclose such information will request confidential treatment of the information and only disclose the minimum amount of information reasonably necessary to comply with such law, court order or rule, or government authority. Page 4 of 31 Source: {{party_name}}, 8-K, {{effective_date}} 4.08 Disclosures in Patent Applications. Notwithstanding anything else in this {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} may disclose the minimum amount of {{party_name}}’s Confidential {{party_name}} reasonably necessary to support a {{party_name}} Patent subject to the review process in {{party_name}} 6.02 (Solicitation of {{party_name}} Patents). {{amount}}/Destruction.

However, notwithstanding anything else in this {{party_name}}, the Receiving {{party_name}} may retain such documents and materials to the extent such documents and materials are identified as necessary for beneficial use of a further {{party_name}} or a license granted herein and the Receiving {{party_name}} has notified the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} in writing of the need for such documents and materials. Any dispute over whether such documents and materials are necessary shall be escalated to senior management for resolution. Furthermore, notwithstanding anything else in this {{party_name}} 4.09, the Receiving {{party_name}} may retain one (1) copy of such documents and materials in its secure files for the sole purpose of administering its obligations under this {{party_name}} and the Receiving {{party_name}} will not be required to purge or cause others to purge electronic archival media automatically generated by backup computer systems if said media will be destroyed pursuant to a systematic records retention process and not otherwise utilized. 4.10 Third {{party_name}} Information. Neither {{party_name}} will knowingly disclose to the other {{party_name}} any proprietary or confidential information belonging to a Non-{{party_name}}d Third {{party_name}} without the Receiving {{party_name}}’s prior written consent.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either {{party_name}} may make such disclosure as it may determine to be required by applicable law (such as filing with {{party_name}}), provided that in such case the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} will provide advance notice of such disclosure to the other {{party_name}} and, where legally permitted, an opportunity to redact its sensitive proprietary information from such disclosure. Further, during the Term, each {{party_name}} agrees that it will not use the name, service mark or trademark of the other {{party_name}}, or any {{party_name}} of the other {{party_name}}, or provide any indication from which the identity of the other {{party_name}} or its {{party_name}} may reasonably be inferred in any publicity release or other announcement, without first obtaining the written approval of the other {{party_name}}. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each {{party_name}} hereby grants approval for the other {{party_name}} to use its name, service mark or trademark in promotional materials that have a generally accepted description of the Scope, which such generally accepted description shall be mutually agreed to in writing beforehand. An exception to this {{party_name}} will include U.S. patent prosecution that refers to this {{party_name}} as a “joint research agreement” under 35 U.S.C. § 102(c). Further, each {{party_name}} agrees to include appropriate attribution of the other {{party_name}} in any publicity release, advertising, print, media or other announcement concerning the use of MCFCs for carbon capture, the {{party_name}} or the {{party_name}} Results. Page 5 of 31 Source: {{party_name}}, 8-K, {{effective_date}} 5.02 Publications. The Parties recognize that {{party_name}} Information may be suitable for publication either jointly or individually. Unless the other {{party_name}} specifically requests in writing not to be credited, appropriate recognition of the support or encouragement of the other {{party_name}} will be included in such publications. The Parties agree to cooperate with each other on the preparation of any such publications. If any proposed publication contains the non-publishing {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}}, such information (including reference thereto) will be deleted at the non-publishing {{party_name}}’s request. No publication that violates Article 4 (Disclosure, Confidentiality and Restricted Use) or {{party_name}} 5.01 (Publicity) will be permitted without the prior written consent of the other {{party_name}} which may be obtained from a duly authorized member of each {{party_name}}. ARTICLE 6 - OWNERSHIP / PROCUREMENT OF PROGRAM RESULTS 6.01 Ownership of {{party_name}} Results. {{party_name}} will solely own {{party_name}} Information, {{party_name}} Patents, and copyrightable works resulting from the {{party_name}} (collectively, “{{party_name}} Results”), irrespective of whether the {{party_name}} Results are conceived, created, developed or acquired by employees or other representatives of {{party_name}}, {{party_name}}, or both. {{party_name}} will assign, and hereby assigns, to {{party_name}} ownership of {{party_name}} Results. 6.02 Solicitation of {{party_name}} Patents. {{party_name}} will have the sole responsibility and the exclusive right to prepare, file, prosecute, and maintain {{party_name}} Patents pursuant to {{party_name}} 6.01 (Ownership of {{party_name}} Results). Such right will include the right to determine if, where, and when patent applications are filed, and the scope of such patent applications. Notwithstanding the foregoing, {{party_name}} shall provide {{party_name}} notice of its intent to file any patent application containing {{party_name}}’s Confidential {{party_name}} and an opportunity for {{party_name}} to review any such patent application for {{party_name}}’s Confidential {{party_name}}. If {{party_name}} does not respond within thirty ({{effective_date}} from {{party_name}} seeking such consent, then {{party_name}} may proceed with such filing. The cost of preparing, filing, prosecuting, and maintaining any such patent applications that {{party_name}} decides to pursue and maintain, as well as the cost of maintaining any patents resulting therefrom, will be paid in full by {{party_name}}. For {{party_name}} Patents, if one or more employees or other representatives of {{party_name}} are determined to be inventors, then {{party_name}} will: (i) cause its employees, contractors, and consultants to render reasonable and timely assistance to {{party_name}} and its attorneys or agents; (ii) assign, and will cause its and its {{party_name}}s’ employees, contractors, and consultants to assign, its right, title, and interest in and to such {{party_name}} Patent to {{party_name}} for filing; and (iii) cause its and its {{party_name}} employees, contractors, and consultants, to execute any documents as may be required to effect such assignments, or file, prosecute, and maintain any patent applications or patents that are based on, derived from, or protect such {{party_name}} Patent. {{party_name}} will hold formal legal title to all such patent applications, and resulting patents. 6.03 Cooperation in Soliciting {{party_name}} Patents. The Parties agree to cooperate in the preparation, filing, prosecution, and securing of patent applications and patents, all without charge to such other {{party_name}}. When {{party_name}}’s patent counsel sends to {{party_name}} documents for review that contains {{party_name}} Confidential {{party_name}}, the Parties will follow the review process pursuant to {{party_name}} 6.02 (Solicitation of {{party_name}} Patents). Upon {{party_name}}’s written request, {{party_name}} will provide a courtesy copy of any {{party_name}} Patent that does not contain any {{party_name}} Confidential {{party_name}} prior to filing such document. All {{party_name}} Patent filings, and the status thereof, will be reported to the {{party_name}}.

The ownership of such {{party_name}} Patent will remain with {{party_name}}. The abandonment of a pending patent application in favor of a continuation patent application, continuation-in-part patent application, or divisional patent application, or in favor of another application of a related subject (e.g. to overcome a double patenting rejection) and {{party_name}}’s decision not to file any {{party_name}} Patent, will not be deemed to be an election not to continue to prosecute, issue, or maintain any {{party_name}} Patent under {{party_name}} {{effective_date}}. In addition, (a) the failure to appeal a patent office or any administrative tribunal or judicial decision adverse to any patent or patent application, or (b) in the case of a co-pending non-provisional application in the U.S., (i) failure to enter an international patent application into the national phase, or (ii) to ratify a patent in any country, will not be deemed to be an election not to continue to prosecute, issue, or maintain any {{party_name}} Patent under {{party_name}} {{effective_date}}. 6.06 Joint Research {{party_name}}.

The specification of any patent application filed pursuant to this {{party_name}} may contain (or may be amended to contain) language required to invoke 35 U.S.C. §102(b)(2)(C) and §102(c) as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in {{party_name}} 5.01 (Publicity), {{party_name}} will have the right to invoke these statutory provisions when exercising its rights to file patent applications under this {{party_name}}, without the prior written consent of {{party_name}}, subject to the provisions of {{party_name}} 6.02 (Solicitation of {{party_name}} Patents). Where {{party_name}} intends to invoke these statutory provisions, {{party_name}}, upon request, will cooperate and coordinate its activities with {{party_name}} with respect to any submissions, filings or other activities in support thereof. 6.07 Inventor Awards. A {{party_name}} will not be responsible for any inventor awards or compensation that may be owed to the other {{party_name}}’s employee(s) or to any employees of the other {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}}s, agents, consultants, or contractors, who are inventors of any {{party_name}} Invention. 6.08 Disposal of Prior JDA {{party_name}} Patents. During the Term of this {{party_name}} and for two (2) years thereafter, in the event that either {{party_name}} decides to sell or convey its interest in or otherwise dispose of any Prior JDA {{party_name}} Patent to any Non-{{party_name}}d Third {{party_name}}, such {{party_name}} will inform the other {{party_name}}, who will then have the right of first refusal to purchase or otherwise acquire the sole interest at same or better terms. Any sale of a Prior JDA {{party_name}} Patent to a Non-{{party_name}}d Third {{party_name}} is subject to the licenses granted and other obligations set forth in this {{party_name}}.

A {{party_name}} believing that it is entitled to indemnification under Section 12.1.1 or 12.1.2 (an “Indemnified {{party_name}}”) will give prompt written notice (each, an “Indemnification {{party_name}} Notice”) to the other {{party_name}} (the “Indemnifying {{party_name}}”) upon receipt of notice of the commencement of any {{party_name}} for which indemnification may be sought, or if earlier, upon the assertion of any such {{party_name}} by a {{party_name}} (it being understood and agreed, however, that the failure by an Indemnified {{party_name}} to give notice of a {{party_name}} of a {{party_name}} as provided in this Section 12.2.1 will not relieve the Indemnifying {{party_name}} of its indemnification obligation under this {{party_name}} except and only to the extent that such Indemnifying {{party_name}} is actually prejudiced as a result of such failure to give notice). Each Indemnification {{party_name}} Notice will contain a description of the {{party_name}} and the nature and amount of the {{party_name}} (to the extent that the nature and amount of such {{party_name}} are known at such time). The Indemnified {{party_name}} will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} copies of all papers and official documents received in respect of any {{party_name}}. 12.2.2 {{party_name}}. At its option, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} may assume the defense of any {{party_name}} by giving written notice to the Indemnified {{party_name}} within [***] after the Indemnifying {{party_name}}’s receipt of an Indemnification {{party_name}} Notice. The assumption of the defense of a {{party_name}} by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will not be construed as an acknowledgment that the Indemnifying {{party_name}} is liable to indemnify the Indemnified {{party_name}} in respect of the {{party_name}}, nor will it constitute a waiver by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} of any defenses it may assert against the Indemnified {{party_name}}’s claim for indemnification. Upon assuming the defense of a {{party_name}}, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} may appoint as lead counsel in the defense of the {{party_name}} any legal counsel selected by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} that is reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified {{party_name}}. In the event the Indemnifying {{party_name}} assumes the defense of a {{party_name}}, the Indemnified {{party_name}} will promptly deliver to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} all original notices and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified {{party_name}} in connection with the {{party_name}}. Should the Indemnifying {{party_name}} assume the defense of a {{party_name}}, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will not be liable to the Indemnified {{party_name}} for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified {{party_name}} in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of such {{party_name}}. 12.2.3 Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 12.2.2, the Indemnified {{party_name}} will be entitled to (a) participate in, but not control, the defense of such {{party_name}} and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such engagement will be at the Indemnified {{party_name}}’s own expense unless the engagement thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} in writing, and (b) control its defense of such {{party_name}} and to engage counsel of its choice for such purpose, at the expense of the Indemnifying {{party_name}}, if the Indemnifying {{party_name}} has failed to assume the defense and engage counsel in accordance with Section 12.2.2. 12.2.4 Settlement. With respect to any {{party_name}} related solely to payment of money damages in connection with a {{party_name}} and that includes a complete and unconditional Source: PHASEBIO PHARMAC{{party_name}}TICALS INC, 10-K, {{effective_date}} release of the Indemnified {{party_name}}, will not result in the Indemnified {{party_name}} admitting liability, becoming subject to injunctive or other equitable relief that will otherwise adversely affect the business of the Indemnified {{party_name}} in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will have acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the Indemnified {{party_name}} hereunder, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such {{party_name}}, on such terms as the Indemnifying {{party_name}}, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. With respect to all other {{party_name}} in connection with {{party_name}}s, where the Indemnifying {{party_name}} has assumed the defense of the {{party_name}} in accordance with Section 12.2.2, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such {{party_name}} provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified {{party_name}} (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). The Indemnifying {{party_name}} will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a {{party_name}} by the Indemnified {{party_name}} that is reached without the written consent of the Indemnifying {{party_name}} (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). Regardless of whether the Indemnifying {{party_name}} chooses to defend or prosecute any {{party_name}}, the Indemnified {{party_name}} will not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any {{party_name}} without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying {{party_name}}, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed. 12.2.5 Cooperation. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying {{party_name}} chooses to defend or prosecute any {{party_name}}, the Indemnified {{party_name}} will reasonably cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection therewith. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified {{party_name}} of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such {{party_name}}, and making employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder, and the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will reimburse the Indemnified {{party_name}} for all its reasonable out-of-pocket expenses in connection therewith. 12.3 Insurance. 12.3.1 Generally. Commencing as of {{party_name}} and thereafter during the Development {{party_name}}, and subject to Section 12.3.2 below, each {{party_name}} will carry and maintain, at its own expense, insurance coverage of the kind and with liability limits that, at a minimum, satisfy the requirements of Section 12.3.2, to protect itself and the other {{party_name}} against any claims or liabilities that may arise from the conduct of {{party_name}} and all other rights and obligations hereunder with insurers with a minimum “A-” A.M. Best rating. Any deductibles for such insurance policies will be assumed by the insuring {{party_name}}. Such insurance policies will be primary and non-contributing with respect to any other similar insurance policies available to other {{party_name}} and their {{party_name}}s. Prior to {{party_name}}, and {{effective_date}}, at each anniversary of {{party_name}} (unless, during {{effective_date}}, expiration of the applicable policy occurs first, in which case, on such expiration date), at a {{party_name}}’s written request the other {{party_name}} will supply documentation of such insurance coverage via original certificates of insurance, if applicable. Source: PHASEBIO PHARMAC{{party_name}}TICALS INC, 10-K, {{effective_date}} Each {{party_name}} will provide the other {{party_name}} a minimum of [***] prior written notice if it is unable to obtain appropriate insurance coverage or if its coverage is canceled, unable to be renewed or materially changed. For clarity, any insurance coverage or the failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage does not limit or reduce a {{party_name}}’s liability under this {{party_name}}. Each {{party_name}} will ensure that no subcontractor, including any Permitted {{party_name}}, will continue to perform the work unless such subcontractor is insured as deemed appropriate by the {{party_name}} engaging the Permitted {{party_name}}. 12.3.2 Minimum Requirements. Commencing as of the start of {{party_name}} and thereafter, during the {{party_name}} (or longer if otherwise stated below), at a minimum, each {{party_name}} will maintain the following types of insurance coverage at a minimum level that is the greater of (a) the highest minimum level required by {{party_name}} in the countries in which {{party_name}} and other obligations hereunder are being performed or (b) the following (to the extent different). 12.3.2.1 {{party_name}}: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence; [***] dollars ($[***]) Product and {{party_name}} aggregate, including {{party_name}}, Product and {{party_name}}; [***] dollars ($[***]) combined single limit on all owned, non-owned and hired vehicles of such {{party_name}}. 12.3.2.2 {{party_name}}: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence. 12.3.2.3 {{party_name}}s Liability: [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence. {{party_name}} will obtain such {{party_name}}s Liability insurance on a global basis, and, if required, supplemented {{party_name}}s Liability Insurance in the US, at its expense and {{party_name}} will obtain supplemental {{party_name}}s Liability insurance for the {{party_name}} Territory and on a country specific basis in the European {{party_name}} Countries as required by {{party_name}} at its expense, which will be considered Development Costs. Coverage must be maintained for as long as required by {{party_name}} in each country after release of the last Subject from {{party_name}} or where there is no legal requirement at least [***] after the termination of this {{party_name}}. 12.3.2.4 {{party_name}}: Any subcontractor, including any Permitted {{party_name}}, who provides professional services to such {{party_name}} for {{party_name}}, will obtain {{party_name}} Insurance in lieu of {{party_name}} Insurance, with a minimum limit of [***] dollars ($[***]) per occurrence. Coverage must be maintained for at least [***] after the later of (i) expiration or early termination of this {{party_name}} and (ii) release of the last Subject from {{party_name}}. 12.3.3 {{party_name}}. Each {{party_name}} will include the other {{party_name}} and its {{party_name}}s as additional insured parties on such {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} Liability insurance, as set forth in Section 12.3.2.3 for [***] after the later of termination of this {{party_name}} or release of the last Subject from {{party_name}}. 12.3.4 {{party_name}}.

If {{party_name}} approves a Third {{party_name}} subcontractor of RevMed following {{party_name}}, or such Third {{party_name}} is named in the {{party_name}} or the {{party_name}}ment Plan, then RevMed, unless otherwise explicitly waived by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} Manager, shall enter into a written agreement with such Third {{party_name}} substantially in a form approved by {{party_name}} and such Third {{party_name}} shall be deemed a Permitted Subcontractor or {{party_name}}er under this Agreement. Each {{party_name}} shall remain liable for any action or failure to act by its {{party_name}}s, {{party_name}} or subcontractors to whom such {{party_name}}’s obligations under this Agreement have been delegated, subcontracted or sublicensed and which action or failure to act would constitute a breach of this Agreement if such action or failure to act were committed by such {{party_name}}. Such {{party_name}} shall require that such {{party_name}}s, {{party_name}} and subcontractors agree in writing to comply with the applicable terms and conditions of this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, if a {{party_name}} first engages a subcontractor after {{party_name}} to perform any activities assigned to it under this Agreement, such {{party_name}} shall require that such subcontractor be bound by written obligations of confidentiality and non-use consistent with this Agreement and shall have agreed to assign to the {{party_name}} engaging such subcontractor (or, if an assignment cannot be made, grant an irrevocable, perpetual, fully-paid, exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to such {{party_name}}, with the right to sublicense through multiple tiers, to {{party_name}}, {{party_name}}, {{party_name}}, Commercialize and otherwise exploit {{effective_date}} Inhibitors and {{party_name}}) under all Program Inventions made by such subcontractor in the course of performing such subcontracted work that relate to any {{party_name}} or their use, manufacture or sale. 27 Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, {{effective_date}} 3.5 {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitors.

For purposes of this Section, [***]. (b) If [***] (such determination, the “{{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor Licensing Decision” and such Third {{party_name}}’s rights, the “{{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor License Rights”), then prior to commencing any negotiations with any Third {{party_name}} with regard to any {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor License Rights, RevMed shall promptly notify {{party_name}} in writing of such {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor Licensing Decision and provide to {{party_name}} a detailed summary of the data then in RevMed’s {{party_name}} regarding the relevant {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor. {{party_name}} shall notify RevMed in writing (a “{{party_name}}”), within [***] after {{party_name}}’s receipt of such notice, if {{party_name}} desires to enter into negotiations with RevMed of the terms under which {{party_name}} would obtain {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor License Rights. If {{party_name}} provides a {{party_name}} to RevMed within [***], then (i) RevMed shall, upon request of {{party_name}}, provide {{party_name}} with reasonable access to all other then-existing Know-How in RevMed’s {{party_name}} that exists in either paper or electronic form and pertains to the relevant {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor and (ii) the Parties shall negotiate exclusively in good faith and on a commercially reasonable basis the terms of a definitive agreement under which {{party_name}} would be granted {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor License Rights for [***] after RevMed receives such {{party_name}} (such period, the “{{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor Licensing Negotiation Period”). If {{party_name}} provides such {{party_name}} during [***], then RevMed shall not negotiate with any Third {{party_name}} the terms under which such Third {{party_name}} would obtain any development or commercialization rights with respect to a {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor during the {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor Licensing Negotiation Period. If (x) {{party_name}} does not provide a {{party_name}} within [***] or (y) {{party_name}} does provide a {{party_name}} within [***] but Parties have not entered into an agreement under which {{party_name}} is granted {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor License Rights prior to the expiration of the {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor Licensing Negotiation Period, then RevMed shall have no further obligations to {{party_name}} with respect to such {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor {{party_name}}, and RevMed shall have the right to enter into negotiations and execute an agreement with a Third {{party_name}} under which such Third {{party_name}} is granted the {{effective_date}} Dual Inhibitor License Rights [***].

Except as expressly set forth herein, neither {{party_name}} shall acquire any license or other intellectual property interest, by implication or otherwise, under or to any trademarks, {{party_name}}, Know-How, or other intellectual property rights {{party_name}}led by the other {{party_name}}. For clarity, any exclusive license granted to each {{party_name}} under any particular Patent Rights or Know-How {{party_name}}led by the other {{party_name}} shall confer exclusivity to the {{party_name}} obtaining such license only to the extent the {{party_name}} granting such license {{party_name}}s the exclusive rights to such Patent Rights or Know-How. 28 Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, {{effective_date}} 3.7 Technology Transfers.

(b) Ongoing. Following {{party_name}}, RevMed shall disclose to the {{party_name}} on a [***] basis all RevMed Licensed Know-How created, generated, invented or developed by or on behalf of RevMed under the {{party_name}}. In addition, upon {{party_name}}’s reasonable written request, RevMed shall deliver to {{party_name}} updates to the Index, and related RevMed Licensed Know-How, including the data regarding the structure and biochemical and other characteristics of such {{effective_date}} Inhibitors that then exists in RevMed’s database(s). (c) Breach of Section 3.7(a) or 3.7(b) by RevMed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in {{effective_date}}), in the event {{party_name}} believes RevMed has materially breached Section 3.7(a) or 3.7(b), {{party_name}} shall so notify RevMed in writing. RevMed may, within [***] following receipt of such notice from {{party_name}}, request that [***]. {{party_name}}. (a) Efforts.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, this Section 3.8 and the term “commercially reasonable good faith efforts” do not require that either {{party_name}} (i) offer, negotiate, commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold separate order, trust or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, license or other disposition of any capital stock, assets, rights, products or businesses of RevMed or {{party_name}} or its {{party_name}}s, (ii) agree to any restrictions on the businesses of RevMed or {{party_name}} or its {{party_name}}s, or (iii) pay any amount or take any other action to prevent, effect the dissolution of, vacate, or lift any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order in any suit or proceeding that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, an “Antitrust {{party_name}}”), where such Antitrust {{party_name}} would represent a Material Adverse Event for RevMed or {{party_name}}. (b) HSR/{{party_name}}s. Each of RevMed and {{party_name}} will, within [***] after the execution of the Agreement (or such later time as may be agreed to in writing by the Parties) file with {{party_name}} (“{{party_name}}”) and {{party_name}} (“{{party_name}}”) any HSR/{{party_name}} required of it under the HSR Act and, as soon as practicable, file with the appropriate {{party_name}} any other 29 Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, {{effective_date}} HSR/{{party_name}} required of it under any other Antitrust Law as determined in the reasonable opinion of either {{party_name}} with respect to the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Ancillary Agreements. The Parties shall cooperate with one another to the extent necessary in the preparation of any such HSR/{{party_name}}. Each {{party_name}} shall be responsible for its own costs, expenses, and filing fees associated with any HSR/{{party_name}}; provided, however, that {{party_name}} shall bear solely all fees (other than penalties that may be incurred as a result of actions or omissions on the part of a {{party_name}}, which penalties shall be the sole financial responsibility of such {{party_name}}), required to be paid to any {{party_name}} in connection with making any such HSR/{{party_name}}. In the event that the Parties make an HSR/{{party_name}} under this Section 3.8, this Agreement shall terminate (i) at the election of either {{party_name}}, immediately upon notice to the other {{party_name}}, in the event that the {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} or other {{party_name}} obtains a preliminary injunction or final order under Antitrust Law enjoining the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, or (ii) at the election of either {{party_name}}, immediately upon notice to the other {{party_name}}, in the event that {{party_name}} shall not have occurred on or prior to [***] after the date upon which a HSR/{{party_name}} has been submitted by each {{party_name}} to a {{party_name}} in relation to the Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except for the terms and conditions of this Section 3.8, none of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement shall be effective until {{party_name}},” which is agreed and understood to mean, subject to {{party_name}} having been fulfilled or waived in accordance with Section 13.6, the later of (A) if a determination is made pursuant to this Section 3.8 that an HSR/{{party_name}} is not required to be made under any Antitrust Law for this Agreement, the date of such determination, or (B) if a determination is made pursuant to this Section 3.8 that an HSR/{{party_name}} is required to be made under any Antitrust Law for this Agreement, {{party_name}}. As used herein: (1) “Antitrust Clearance Date” means the earliest date on which the Parties have actual knowledge that all applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any comparable waiting periods as required under any other Antitrust Law, in each case with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement have expired or have been terminated; and (2) “HSR/{{party_name}}” means (x) a filing by RevMed and a filing by {{party_name}} with the {{party_name}} and the {{party_name}} of a Notification and Report Form for Certain Mergers and Acquisitions (as that term is defined in the HSR Act), together with all required documentary attachments thereto or (y) any comparable filing by RevMed or {{party_name}} required under any other Antitrust Law, in each case ((x) and (y)) with respect to the transaction contemplated by this Agreement. (c) Information Exchange.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Parties will conduct a research program for the identification, validation and optimization of {{effective_date}} Inhibitors (including without limitation back-up compound chemistry and characterization, pre-clinical studies, and translation and biomarker studies) pursuant to a research plan (such plan, the “{{party_name}}”). 4.2 {{party_name}}. (a) {{party_name}} {{party_name}}. (i) Initial. As of {{party_name}}, the Parties have agreed on an initial {{party_name}} {{party_name}} {{party_name}} for Calendar {{effective_date}} and {{effective_date}}, which is set forth in Exhibit H of the {{party_name}}. A. Calendar {{effective_date}}. The initial {{party_name}} {{party_name}} {{party_name}} for Calendar {{effective_date}} are final and may only be amended or modified by mutual agreement of the Parties (i.e., {{party_name}} shall not have the unilateral right, either directly or through its participation in the {{party_name}} or the {{party_name}}, including by exercising its final decision-making power under Section 2.10(b), [***]). B. Calendar {{effective_date}} {{effective_date}}. The initial {{party_name}} {{party_name}} for Calendar {{effective_date}} {{effective_date}} included in Exhibit H of the {{party_name}} represents, as of {{party_name}}, what the Parties believe to be a reasonable estimate of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} for Calendar {{effective_date}} {{effective_date}} and shall become final only if the Parties mutually agree in writing with respect to the detailed {{party_name}} activities and timelines to be set forth in the {{party_name}} for Calendar {{effective_date}} {{effective_date}}. Upon any such mutual agreement, such {{party_name}} {{party_name}} {{party_name}} may only be amended or modified by mutual agreement of the Parties (i.e., {{party_name}} shall not have the right to exercise its final decision-making power under Section 2.10(b), [***]. If the Parties do not reach such mutual agreement and {{party_name}} exercises its final decision-making power under Section 2.10(b) [***]. For clarity, if the Parties mutually agree upon activities under the {{party_name}} for a {{party_name}} {{party_name}} equal to or greater than that set forth in Exhibit H of the {{party_name}} then Section 4.5(b) shall apply and {{party_name}} shall be responsible for {{amount}} of {{party_name}} Costs and RevMed shall be responsible for {{amount}} of {{party_name}} Costs, provided that {{party_name}} shall be responsible for [***]% of {{party_name}} Costs associated with [***]. 31 Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, {{effective_date}} {{party_name}} {{effective_date}} and {{party_name}}.

(ii) Amendments. From time to time after {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} may propose any amendment to the {{party_name}}, which shall be made in good faith, based on scientific and regulatory judgment. The {{party_name}} shall set forth: (a) the {{party_name}} activities to be conducted by either {{party_name}}; (b) the estimated timelines for such {{party_name}} activities; and (c) a detailed budget setting forth the estimated RevMed R&D Costs to be incurred in connection with such activities (the “{{party_name}} {{party_name}}”). If the terms of the {{party_name}} contradict, or create inconsistencies or ambiguities with, the terms of this Agreement, then the terms of this Agreement shall govern. (b) Conduct of {{party_name}}. Each {{party_name}} shall perform all {{party_name}} activities under this Agreement in compliance with all {{party_name}} (including {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} and {{party_name}}). In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, RevMed shall use diligent efforts to conduct its activities under each {{party_name}} in accordance with the terms of such {{party_name}} (including timelines), as the same may be amended from time to time (and which basis for comparison shall be tolled until any then-contemplated or pending amendments are completed or for the duration of any bona fide dispute between the Parties with respect to a {{party_name}} or amendment thereto), and this Agreement. If {{party_name}} believes RevMed has materially breached its obligation in the foregoing sentences with respect to any Product, {{party_name}} shall so notify RevMed in writing. If either RevMed agrees or it is determined in accordance with [***], that RevMed has committed a material breach of its obligations under this Section 4.2(b) with respect to such Product, the {{party_name}} shall, within [***] after such agreement on or determination of material breach, meet in person or by teleconference to discuss such material breach and specify reasonable actions that RevMed should take to cure such material breach. If RevMed fails to commence within [***] after such discussion occurs such actions recommended by the {{party_name}}, or fails to cure any such material breach within [***] after the {{party_name}} meets (or such longer timeframe as the {{party_name}} decides is necessary to complete the actions specified by the {{party_name}}), then {{party_name}} shall have the right, without prejudice to any other rights or remedies {{party_name}} may have under this Agreement or otherwise at law or in equity, [***]. In such case, RevMed shall, [***], (i) make available [***], (ii) provide [***], and (iii) otherwise provide [***]. 4.3 Designation of {{party_name}}ment Candidates As of {{party_name}}, the Parties agree that the {{effective_date}} Inhibitor set forth on Exhibit I of the {{party_name}} is deemed a {{party_name}}ment Candidate (defined below) under this Agreement. From time to time, either {{party_name}} may nominate one or more additional {{effective_date}} Inhibitors to the {{party_name}} for consideration as a candidate for {{party_name}}ment under a {{party_name}}ment Plan (the “{{party_name}}ment Candidate”). Such nomination (and approval thereof by the {{party_name}}) shall be made prior to the initiation of the {{party_name}}-enabling studies for such {{effective_date}} {{party_name}}), unless otherwise permitted by the {{party_name}}. Promptly after such nomination, each {{party_name}} shall present to the {{party_name}} the data and results it has obtained with respect to such {{effective_date}} {{party_name}}) as well as, if requested by the other {{party_name}}, written records maintained 32 Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, {{effective_date}} by or on behalf of such {{party_name}} or its {{party_name}}s with respect to the discovery or development history of such {{effective_date}} Inhibitor. The {{party_name}} shall determine whether such {{effective_date}} {{party_name}}) shall be approved as a {{party_name}}ment Candidate under this Agreement. The {{party_name}} may also request that further {{party_name}} activities be conducted with respect to such {{effective_date}} {{party_name}}) (under an amended {{party_name}}), after which activities such {{effective_date}} {{party_name}}) may be reconsidered for nomination as a {{party_name}}ment Candidate. If the {{party_name}} (or Designated Senior Officers, as applicable) approve a particular {{effective_date}} Inhibitor as a {{party_name}}ment Candidate, then the Parties shall proceed to conduct further {{party_name}}ment of such {{effective_date}} Inhibitor (including {{party_name}}-enabling studies, other pre-clinical and non-clinical studies, and clinical studies) pursuant to a {{party_name}}ment Plan (as further described in Section 5.2) and under the oversight of the {{party_name}}. In addition, at any time after a {{effective_date}} Inhibitor is designated as a {{party_name}}ment Candidate, if requested by {{party_name}}, RevMed shall make available written records (such as lab notebooks) maintained by or on behalf of RevMed or its {{party_name}}s with respect to the discovery and/or development history of such {{effective_date}} Inhibitor or any Product under {{party_name}}ment that contains such {{effective_date}} Inhibitor, provided that such request shall not be made more than once for each {{effective_date}} Inhibitor or each Product, as applicable, except for cause. 4.4 {{party_name}} Records and Reports. Each {{party_name}} shall maintain complete, current and accurate records of all {{party_name}} activities conducted by it hereunder, and all data and other information resulting from such activities.

Each Indemnification Claim Notice must contain a description of the claim and the nature and amount of such {{party_name}} (to the extent that the nature and amount of such {{party_name}} are known at such time). Together with the Indemnification Claim Notice, the Indemnified {{party_name}} will furnish promptly to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} copies of all notices and documents (including court papers) received by any {{party_name}} in connection with the Third {{party_name}} Claim. (b) {{party_name}}. At its option, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} may assume the defense of any Third {{party_name}} Claim subject to indemnification as provided for in Section 14.1 or Section 14.2 by giving written notice to the Indemnified {{party_name}} within [***] after the Indemnifying {{party_name}}’s receipt of an Indemnification Claim Notice. Upon assuming the defense of a Third {{party_name}} Claim, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} may select and appoint the lead legal counsel for the defense of the Third {{party_name}} Claim. Should the Indemnifying {{party_name}} assume the defense of a Third {{party_name}} Claim, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will not be liable to the Indemnified {{party_name}} or any other {{party_name}} for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified {{party_name}} or other {{party_name}} in connection with the analysis, defense or settlement of the Third {{party_name}} Claim. 72 Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, {{effective_date}} (c) Right to Participate in Defense. Without limiting Section 14.3(b), any {{party_name}} will be entitled to participate in, but not control, the defense of such Third {{party_name}} Claim and to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that such employment will be at the {{party_name}}’s own expense unless (a) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} in writing, or (b) the Indemnifying {{party_name}} has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel in accordance with Section 14.3(b) (in which case the Indemnified {{party_name}} will control the defense). (d) Settlement. With respect to any {{party_name}} relating solely to the payment of money damages in connection with a Third {{party_name}} Claim and that will not result in the {{party_name}}’s becoming subject to injunctive or other relief or otherwise adversely affect the business of the {{party_name}} in any manner, and as to which the Indemnifying {{party_name}} has acknowledged in writing the obligation to indemnify the {{party_name}} hereunder, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will have the sole right to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such {{party_name}}, on such terms as the Indemnifying {{party_name}}, in its sole discretion, will deem appropriate. The Indemnifying {{party_name}} will pay all amounts on behalf of the Indemnified {{party_name}} at or prior to the time of the entry of judgment. With respect to all other {{party_name}} in connection with Third {{party_name}} Claims, where the Indemnifying {{party_name}} has assumed the defense of the Third {{party_name}} Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b), the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will have authority to consent to the entry of any judgment, enter into any settlement or otherwise dispose of such {{party_name}} provided it obtains the prior written consent of the Indemnified {{party_name}} (which consent will be at the Indemnified {{party_name}}’s sole and absolute discretion). The Indemnifying {{party_name}} that has assumed the defense of the Third {{party_name}} Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b) will not be liable for any settlement or other disposition of a {{party_name}} by an {{party_name}} that is reached without the written consent of such Indemnifying {{party_name}}. Regardless of whether the Indemnifying {{party_name}} chooses to defend any Third {{party_name}} Claim, no {{party_name}} will admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge, any Third {{party_name}} Claim without first offering to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} the opportunity to assume the defense of the Third {{party_name}} Claim in accordance with Section 14.3(b). (e) Cooperation. If the Indemnifying {{party_name}} chooses to defend any Third {{party_name}} Claim, the Indemnified {{party_name}} will, and will cause each other {{party_name}} to, cooperate in the defense thereof and will furnish such records, information and testimony, provide such witnesses and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials and appeals as may be reasonably requested in connection with the defense of such Third {{party_name}} Claim. Such cooperation will include access during normal business hours afforded to the Indemnifying {{party_name}} to, and reasonable retention by the Indemnified {{party_name}} of, records and information that are reasonably relevant to such Third {{party_name}} Claim, and making {{party_name}}s and other employees and agents available on a mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided hereunder. The Indemnifying {{party_name}} will reimburse the Indemnified {{party_name}} for all its reasonable out-of-pocket costs in connection with such cooperation. (f) Expenses. Except as provided above, the reasonable and verifiable costs and expenses, including fees and disbursements of counsel, incurred by the Indemnified {{party_name}} in connection with any claim will be reimbursed on a [***] by the Indemnifying {{party_name}}, without prejudice to the Indemnifying {{party_name}}’s right to contest the Indemnified {{party_name}}’s right to indemnification and subject to refund in the event the Indemnifying {{party_name}} is ultimately held not to be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified {{party_name}}. 73 Source: REVOLUTION MEDICINES, INC., S-1, {{effective_date}} 14.4 Mitigation of {{party_name}}. Each Indemnified {{party_name}} shall take and shall procure that its {{party_name}} take all such reasonable steps and action as are reasonably necessary or as the Indemnifying {{party_name}} may reasonably require in order to mitigate any Third {{party_name}} Claims (or potential losses or damages) under this Article XIV.

The {{party_name}} or other Indemnitee intending to claim indemnification under this Section 11 (an “{{party_name}} {{party_name}}”) shall promptly notify the other {{party_name}} (the “Indemnifying {{party_name}}”) of any {{party_name}} in respect of which the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} intends to claim such indemnification (provided, that no delay or deficiency on the part of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} in so notifying the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will relieve the Indemnifying {{party_name}} of any liability or obligation under this {{party_name}} except to the extent the Indemnifying {{party_name}} has suffered actual prejudice directly caused by the delay or other deficiency), and the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall assume the defense thereof (with counsel selected by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} and reasonably satisfactory to the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}) whether or not such {{party_name}} is rightfully brought; provided, however, that an {{party_name}} {{party_name}} shall have the right to retain its own counsel and participate in the defense thereof, with the fees and expenses to be paid by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, unless the Indemnifying {{party_name}} does not assume the defense or unless a representation of both the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} and the Indemnifying {{party_name}} by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to the actual or potential differing interests between them, in which case the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel retained by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} shall be paid by the Indemnifying {{party_name}}. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in no event shall the Indemnifying {{party_name}} be required to pay for more than one separate counsel no matter the number or circumstances of all {{party_name}} Parties. If the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall fail to timely assume the defense of and reasonably defend such {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} shall have the right to retain or assume control of such defense and the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall pay (as incurred and on demand) the fees and expenses of counsel retained by the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} and all other expenses of investigation and litigation. The {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, and its directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying {{party_name}} and its legal representatives in the investigations of any {{party_name}}. The Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall not be liable for the indemnification of any {{party_name}} settled (or resolved by consent to the entry of judgment) without the written consent of the Indemnifying {{party_name}}. Also, if the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall control the defense of any such {{party_name}}, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall have the right to settle such {{party_name}}; provided, that the Indemnifying {{party_name}} shall obtain the prior written consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) of the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} before entering into any settlement of (or resolving by consent to the entry of judgment upon) such {{party_name}} unless (A) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person or entity by an {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, no requirement that the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} admit fault or culpability, and no adverse effect on any other claims that may be made by or against the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} and (B) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} and such settlement does not require the {{party_name}} {{party_name}} to take (or refrain from taking) any action. 17 Source: {{party_name}}, S-4/A, {{effective_date}} Regardless of who controls the defense, the other {{party_name}} hereto shall reasonably cooperate in the defense as may be requested. Without limitation, the {{party_name}} hereto which is not the Indemnifying {{party_name}} and (if different) the {{party_name}} {{party_name}}, and their respective directors, officers, advisers, agents and employees, shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying {{party_name}} and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any {{party_name}}. 11.5. Expenses of Enforcement. As the Parties intend complete indemnification, all costs and expenses of enforcing any provision of this Section 11 shall also be reimbursed by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} except as otherwise set forth in Section 11.4. 11.6. Insurance. {{party_name}}, at its own expense, shall procure and maintain during the {{party_name}}, insurance policies with the minimum coverages set forth below (“Insurance”). {{party_name}} shall be named as an additional insured with respect to the Insurance. The Insurance shall be primary for all purposes to other insurance coverage, whether such other insurance is stated to be primary, contributory, excess, contingent or otherwise, without recourse to or contribution from any {{party_name}}-owned coverage. (a) Commercial General Liability Insurance - Combined single limit for bodily and property damage of not {{amount}} for each occurrence and ${{amount}} {{effective_date}} aggregate providing: ● Assault and Battery coverage, ● Broad form property damage coverage, ● Broad form contractual liability coverage, ● {{party_name}}s and completed operations coverage, and ● Personal and advertising injury coverage.

All {{party_name}}’s Insurance shall be placed with an insurer that (a) has an {{party_name}} rating of A- or better or (b) is a qualified self- insurance program that is approved by {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} shall provide {{party_name}}, upon request, with written evidence of the Insurance, including where it is provided through qualified self-insurance. Nothing in this Section shall be deemed to limit {{party_name}}’s responsibility to the amounts stated above or to any limits of {{party_name}}’s insurance policies. 12. {{party_name}} 12.1. {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} shall be responsible for maintaining, at its sole cost, the {{party_name}} required for the marketing and sale of the {{party_name}}s in the Applicable Markets. {{party_name}} shall hold in its name {{party_name}} required for the marketing and sale of the {{party_name}}s in a country or region and shall (to the extent commercially reasonable to do so) maintain in good standing all existing {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} shall provide reasonable advice and assistance to each other as may be necessary to maintain required {{party_name}}.

Communication With Agencies. In the Applicable Markets, {{party_name}} shall have responsibility for communications with {{party_name}} concerning any required {{party_name}}, approval of {{party_name}} related marketing and advertising materials, and {{party_name}} quality matters. 12.4. {{party_name}}. Each {{party_name}} shall advise the other {{party_name}} promptly (but in any event within {{amount}}) of any warning (including any {{party_name}} Form 483), citation, indictment, claim, lawsuit, or proceeding issued or instituted by any federal, state or local governmental entity or agency against the {{party_name}}, or of any revocation of any license or permit if, and only to the extent that, the manufacture, storage, or handling of the {{party_name}}, or the marketing, selling, promotion or distribution of the {{party_name}}, is affected. 12.5. {{party_name}}, Recalls and {{party_name}}. {{party_name}} shall have responsibility to determine whether any {{party_name}}, Recalls or {{party_name}} information must be reported to the {{party_name}} (under United States law) or any other {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} shall have responsibility to prepare and submit notification of {{party_name}}, Recalls and/or {{party_name}} to respective {{party_name}} for the {{party_name}}s. {{party_name}} shall provide prompt notice to {{party_name}} of any {{party_name}}, Recalls or {{party_name}}, which notice shall in any event be delivered within no more than 3 business days from {{party_name}} learning of such occurrence. 12.6.

If an investigation is needed in response to a complaint or inquiry related to the {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} shall perform the investigation and shall bear the cost of such investigation. The documentation of such investigation shall include, but not be limited to, investigation results, cause analysis, corrective and preventative action and health hazard/medical assessment, as appropriate. In the event a {{party_name}} is returned by a customer for investigation, {{party_name}} shall ship a replacement {{party_name}} to the customer. (Provided, that if a request for a return of {{party_name}} is due to a change of mind over using the {{party_name}} or the {{party_name}} customer has overstocked the product, rather than due to a warranty issue, {{party_name}} need not accept the return or provide any replacement or substitute.) {{party_name}} shall retain records of all {{party_name}} related complaints, or {{party_name}} for a period of not less than five (5) {{effective_date}} beyond the expiration date of the {{party_name}} or for such longer period as may be required by applicable law. {{party_name}} shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that all complaints are appropriately closed within {{effective_date}} or less from the receipt of such complaint. 19 Source: {{party_name}}, S-4/A, {{effective_date}} 12.7. {{party_name}} Recalls. In the event that (i) any Applicable Market governmental agency or authority issues a request or directive or orders that the {{party_name}}s be recalled or retrieved, (ii) an Applicable Market court of competent jurisdiction orders that the {{party_name}}s be recalled or retrieved, or (iii) {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} reasonably determine, after mutual consultation, that the {{party_name}}s should be recalled, corrected or retrieved in any particular country or countries, {{party_name}} and/or {{party_name}} shall conduct such activity and the parties shall take all appropriate corrective actions and shall execute the steps detailed in the recall strategy. {{party_name}} shall be responsible for the content of any communication to the customers regarding any Recall or Field Correction.

If {{party_name}} receives a complaint from any {{party_name}} with regard to the {{party_name}}s, {{party_name}} shall notify {{party_name}} promptly, but in any event within {{amount}}. {{party_name}} shall have the responsibility to correspond with the {{party_name}}, as {{party_name}}, regarding any such complaints. If corrective actions are required, the cost of the corrective action shall be borne by {{party_name}} up to the extent such complaint is related to the manufacturing of the {{party_name}}s by {{party_name}}, or some other cause or event attributable to {{party_name}}, and shall be borne by {{party_name}} up to the extent such complaint is due to some other cause or event attributable to {{party_name}}. 20 Source: {{party_name}}, S-4/A, {{effective_date}} {{effective_date}}. {{party_name}}; Audit Rights {{effective_date}}.1. {{party_name}}. It is contemplated that in the course of the performance of this {{party_name}} each {{party_name}} may, from time to time, disclose proprietary and confidential information to the other (“{{party_name}}”). Except to the extent expressly authorized by this {{party_name}} or otherwise agreed to in writing, during the {{party_name}} and for a period of five (5) {{effective_date}} following the expiration or termination of this {{party_name}}, the receiving {{party_name}} shall disclose the other {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} only to its own (or its {{party_name}}’) officers, employees, consultants, Third {{party_name}} service providers, attorneys, accountants, agents, bankers, lenders, prospective lenders and prospective equity investors, and in each case only if and to the extent necessary to carry out their respective responsibilities under this {{party_name}} or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this {{party_name}} or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit), and such disclosure shall be limited to the maximum extent possible consistent with such responsibilities and rights. Except as set forth in the foregoing sentence, neither {{party_name}} shall disclose {{party_name}} of the other to any Third {{party_name}} without the other’s prior written consent. In all events, however, any and all disclosure to a Third {{party_name}} (or to any such {{party_name}}) shall be pursuant to the terms of a non-disclosure/nonuse agreement no less restrictive than this Section {{effective_date}} (or, in the case of attorneys, to a duty and obligation of nondisclosure/nonuse pursuant to the applicable rules of the profession). The {{party_name}} which disclosed {{party_name}} of the other to any Third {{party_name}} (or to any such {{party_name}}) shall be responsible and liable for any disclosure or use by such Third {{party_name}} or {{party_name}} (or its disclosees) which would have violated this {{party_name}} if committed by the {{party_name}} itself. Neither {{party_name}} shall use {{party_name}} of the other except as expressly allowed by and for the purposes of this {{party_name}} or in accordance with the exercise of their rights under this {{party_name}} or in accordance with customary permitted practice (such as to seek or maintain financing or credit) or and, after the {{party_name}}, by {{party_name}} only to the extent required to continue to offer and provide goods and services to former {{party_name}} customers of {{party_name}}s. Each {{party_name}} shall take such action to preserve the confidentiality of each other’s {{party_name}} as it would customarily take to preserve the confidentiality of its own {{party_name}} (but in no event less than a reasonable standard of care). Upon expiration or termination of this {{party_name}}, each {{party_name}}, upon the other’s request, promptly shall return or destroy all the {{party_name}} disclosed to the other {{party_name}} pursuant to this {{party_name}}, including all copies, reflections, analyses and extracts of documents, except for one archival copy (and such electronic copies that exist as part of the {{party_name}}’s computer systems, network storage systems and electronic backup systems) of such materials solely to be able to monitor its obligations that survive under this {{party_name}}. The non-use and non-disclosure obligations set forth in this Section {{effective_date}} shall not apply to any {{party_name}}, or portion thereof, that the receiving {{party_name}} can demonstrate: (a) is at the time of disclosure in the public domain; 21 Source: {{party_name}}, S-4/A, {{effective_date}} (b) after disclosure, becomes part of the public domain, by publication or otherwise, through no fault of and or without violation of any duty of confidentiality of the receiving {{party_name}} or its disclosees; (c) at the time of disclosure is already in the receiving {{party_name}}’s possession with no duty of confidentiality, and such prior possession can be demonstrated by the receiving {{party_name}} by written proof (provided that this subsection shall not apply to {{party_name}} exchanged between the Parties before the execution of this {{party_name}} that was subject to a confidentiality obligation at the time of such disclosure); (d) is rightfully received by the receiving {{party_name}} on a non-confidential basis from an independent Third {{party_name}} without obligation of confidentiality; provided, however, that to the receiving {{party_name}}’s best knowledge, such information was not obtained by said Third {{party_name}}, directly or indirectly, from the disclosing {{party_name}}; or (e) is independently developed by or expressly for the receiving {{party_name}}, in either case solely by personnel without any access to or use of the disclosing {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}}, as shown by receiving {{party_name}}’s contemporaneous written records. In the event either {{party_name}} must disclose the other {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} in order to comply with applicable governmental regulations or as otherwise required by law or judicial process, such {{party_name}} shall give reasonable advance notice to the other {{party_name}} of such proposed disclosure in order that the non-disclosing {{party_name}} may intercede and oppose such process, and shall use its best efforts to secure a protective order or confidential-treatment order preventing or limiting (to the greatest possible extent and for the longest possible period) the disclosure and/or requiring that the {{party_name}} so disclosed be used only for the purposes for which the law or regulation required, or for which the order was issued. The Parties acknowledge that the defined term “{{party_name}}” shall include not only a disclosing {{party_name}}’s own {{party_name}} but also {{party_name}} of an {{party_name}} or of a Third {{party_name}} which is in the possession of a disclosing {{party_name}}. However, both Parties agree not to disclose to the other {{party_name}} any {{party_name}} of a Third {{party_name}} which is in the possession of such {{party_name}}, unless the other {{party_name}} has given an express prior written consent (which specifies the owner of such {{party_name}}) to receive such particular {{party_name}}. 22 Source: {{party_name}}, S-4/A, {{effective_date}} Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this {{party_name}} or any other agreement between {{party_name}} and {{party_name}}, nothing in this {{party_name}} or any other agreement between the Parties prohibits, or is intended in any manner to prohibit, either {{party_name}} or {{party_name}} from reporting possible violations of federal law or regulation to any governmental agency or entity, including but not limited to {{party_name}}, {{party_name}}, the {{party_name}}, and any agency {{party_name}}, or making other disclosures that are protected under the whistleblower provisions of federal law or regulation. {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} do not need the prior authorization of anyone at the other {{party_name}} or the other {{party_name}}’s legal counsel to make any such reports or disclosures and they are not required to notify the other {{party_name}} that it has made such reports or disclosures. {{effective_date}}.2. Use of {{party_name}}.

Other than as provided in the foregoing sentence or to the extent such use is based on a public disclosure previously made by the other {{party_name}}, during the {{party_name}} neither {{party_name}} nor {{party_name}} shall use the name of the other in any verbal or written communications with any Third {{party_name}}, except as allowed or contemplated herein, without the prior written consent of the other {{party_name}}. {{effective_date}}.3. {{party_name}}. Neither {{party_name}} shall make any press release or other similar public announcement concerning this {{party_name}} without the prior written consent of the other {{party_name}}, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event such disclosure or public announcement is required to be made on a more immediate basis to comply with applicable laws, then approval will be deemed granted if no response is received from the non-disclosing {{party_name}} within the time frames required by law; provided, however, that the disclosing {{party_name}} provides the non-disclosing {{party_name}} with notice of the legally required time frame for the approval of the disclosure. Neither {{party_name}} shall use the trademark or logo of the other {{party_name}}, its {{party_name}} or their respective employee(s) in any publicity, promotion, news release or public disclosure relating to this {{party_name}} or its subject matter, except as may be required by law or except with the prior express written permission of such other {{party_name}}, such permission not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed, or except in {{party_name}}’s advertisement, promotion and sale of the {{party_name}}s in compliance with this {{party_name}} in the ordinary course of business. Notwithstanding the above, once a public disclosure has been made, either {{party_name}} shall be free to disclose to Third Parties any information contained in said public disclosure, without further pre-review or pre-approval. {{effective_date}}.4.

Each {{party_name}} shall keep accurate books and records in sufficient detail to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this {{party_name}} and enable the other {{party_name}} to determine the correctness of any report made under this {{party_name}} and monitor compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations and this {{party_name}} through the process below. Upon reasonable written notice (and no more often than once {{effective_date}}), the auditing {{party_name}} shall have the right, during normal business hours, to audit the books and records maintained by the audited {{party_name}} pursuant to this {{party_name}} to ensure the accuracy of all reports and payments made hereunder. 23 Source: {{party_name}}, S-4/A, {{effective_date}} 14. {{party_name}}ination 14.1. {{party_name}}ination by Either {{party_name}}.

In addition, all provisions that survive termination, that are irrevocable or that arise due to termination shall survive in accordance with their terms. Any other provisions of this {{party_name}} contemplated by their terms to pertain to a period of time following termination or expiration of this {{party_name}} shall survive only for the specified period of time.

In the event there are unfulfilled orders for {{party_name}}s outstanding as of termination of this {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} may, at its option, cancel such orders upon notice to {{party_name}} (in which case {{party_name}} agrees to fill such orders to {{party_name}}’s end customers directly unless such customer chooses to cancel such order) or cause {{party_name}} to fulfill such orders and invoice {{party_name}} for amounts owed with respect thereto. If either {{party_name}} is aware of an impending expiration or termination of the {{party_name}}, it shall conduct its business with respect to the subject matter of this {{party_name}} in the ordinary course (and not otherwise than in the ordinary course) for the duration of the {{party_name}}. 24 Source: {{party_name}}, S-4/A, {{effective_date}} 15.

No Waiver. Failure of either {{party_name}} to enforce (or reasonable delay in enforcing) a right under this {{party_name}} shall not act as a waiver of that right or the ability to later assert that right relative to the particular situation involved or to terminate this {{party_name}} arising out of any subsequent default or breach. A waiver by a {{party_name}} of any of the terms and conditions of this {{party_name}} in any instance shall not be deemed or construed to be a waiver of such term or condition for the future, or of any other term or condition hereof. 15.4. Severability. This {{party_name}} is divisible and separable. If any provision of this {{party_name}} is determined by a final and binding court judgment (for which no further appeal is possible) to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable to any extent, such provision shall not be not affected or impaired up to the limits of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability; the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this {{party_name}} shall not be affected or impaired in any way; and the affected provision shall (if at all possible) be construed as if it had been written in such a way as to both be valid, legal and enforceable and to achieve, to the greatest lawful extent, the evident economic, business and other purposes of such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision (or portion of provision). 15.5.
