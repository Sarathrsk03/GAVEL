(“{{party_name}}”) ({{party_name}}), a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and commercializing drug candidates for diseases where there is a high unmet need, and {{party_name}} (“{{party_name}}”), one of the largest specialty pharmaceutical companies in the world committed to the prevention and treatment of gastrointestinal diseases and its parent company, {{party_name}} ({{party_name}}/{{party_name}}: {{party_name}}), {{effective_date}} announced that they have entered into an exclusive agreement to co-promote {{party_name}}’s {{party_name}} (avatrombopag) in the United States (U.S.). {{party_name}} ("{{party_name}}") approved {{party_name}} on May 21, 201{{effective_date}} for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease ({{party_name}}) who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. {{party_name}} represents the first thrombopoietin ({{party_name}}) receptor agonist approved in the United States for this indication. {{party_name}}, a condition in which patients have a low platelet count, is the most common hematological abnormality in patients with {{party_name}} that often worsens with the severity of liver disease. It is estimated that {{amount}} of the 7.5 million patients with {{party_name}} have some form of thrombocytopenia. In a study published in {{effective_date}}, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/µL) had a {{amount}} incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the {{party_name}} patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures. As part of the co-promotion arrangement, {{party_name}} intends to deploy approximately 100 sales specialists who will promote {{party_name}} to gastroenterology healthcare professionals. The {{party_name}} sales force will begin selling {{party_name}} in mid-October 201{{effective_date}}. {{party_name}} will continue its commercial efforts targeting primarily hepatologists and interventional radiologists and certain other specialties. Pursuant to the agreement, {{party_name}} will pay {{party_name}} a {{effective_date}} fee based on net sales (as defined in the agreement) of {{party_name}} prescribed by gastroenterologists in the U.S. “We are delighted to be working with {{party_name}}, a company considered by many to have the preeminent gastroenterology sales force in the United States,” said {{party_name}}, president and chief executive officer, {{party_name}} Pharmaceuticals. “Given {{party_name}}’s presence and strong reputation within large gastroenterology group practices coupled with the early interest we are seeing among the gastroenterology community, we are excited to see the impact this partnership will bring to {{party_name}} and to patients.” “{{party_name}} considers liver disease a strategic therapeutic area of focus, given our history and knowledge with {{party_name}} (rifaximin), an innovative medicine indicated for the treatment of overt hepatic encephalopathy (HE), a condition that is often a consequence of chronic liver disease,” said {{party_name}}, president, {{party_name}}. “Adding {{party_name}} to our portfolio will enable our sales force to promote yet another innovative product that addresses a true unmet need in the marketplace.” CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR PORTIONS OF THIS EXHIBIT.

A COMPLETE VERSION OF THIS EXHIBIT HAS BEEN FILED SEPARATELY WITH {{party_name}}. Source: {{party_name}} INC., 10-Q, {{effective_date}} About {{party_name}} {{party_name}} (avatrombopag) is a second generation, once {{effective_date}}, orally administered {{party_name}} receptor agonist approved for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with {{party_name}} who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. {{party_name}} is designed to mimic the effects of {{party_name}}, the primary regulator of normal platelet production. Two global Phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials ({{party_name}}-1 [N=231] and {{party_name}}-2 [N=204]), conducted in adults with thrombocytopenia (platelet count of less than 50,000/µL) and {{party_name}}, supported the {{party_name}} approval. Patients were assigned to either 40 mg or 60 mg of avatrombopag {{effective_date}} for {{effective_date}} based on their Baseline platelet counts (40 to <50,000/µmL or <40,000/µmL, respectively). {{party_name}} was shown to be superior to placebo in increasing the proportion of patients not requiring platelet transfusions or rescue procedures for bleeding {{effective_date}} following a scheduled procedure in both trials in both the 40 mg ({{party_name}}-1, {{amount}} vs. {{amount}}, p <0.0001; {{party_name}}-2, {{amount}} vs. 3{{amount}}; p<0.0001), and 60 mg ({{party_name}}-1, {{amount}} vs. {{amount}}, p <0.0001; {{party_name}}-2, {{amount}} vs. 35%; p=0.0006) treatment groups. {{party_name}} was also superior to placebo at the two secondary efficacy endpoints in each trial. In the avatrombopag treatment groups, there was an increased proportion of patients achieving the target platelet count of ≥50,000/µmL on {{effective_date}}, and a greater magnitude of the change in mean platelet count from baseline to {{effective_date}}; all treatment differences between the avatrombopag and placebo treatment groups for each secondary endpoint were highly statistically significant with p values <0.0001. The most common adverse reactions with avatrombopag included pyrexia, abdominal pain, nausea, headache, fatigue and edema peripheral. Portal vein thromboses have been reported in patients with {{party_name}} and in patients receiving {{party_name}} receptor agonists. One treatment-emergent event of portal vein thrombosis was reported in the {{party_name}} trials in an avatrombopag-treated patient. INDICATION {{party_name}} (avatrombopag) is indicated for the treatment of thrombocytopenia in adult patients with chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo a procedure. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS {{party_name}} is a thrombopoietin ({{party_name}}) receptor agonist and {{party_name}} receptor agonists have been associated with thrombotic and thromboembolic complications in patients with chronic liver disease. Portal vein thrombosis has been reported in patients with chronic liver disease treated with {{party_name}} receptor agonists. In the {{party_name}}-1 and {{party_name}}-2 clinical trials, there was one treatment- emergent event of portal vein thrombosis in a patient (n=1/430) with chronic liver disease and thrombocytopenia treated with {{party_name}}. Consider the potential increased thrombotic risk when administering {{party_name}} to patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism, including genetic prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, {{party_name}}, {{party_name}} deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency). {{party_name}} should not be administered to patients with chronic liver disease in an attempt to normalize platelet counts.
