Further, {{party_name}} shall have the right to authorize carriage of the {{party_name}}’s signal on a nonexclusive basis by MVPDs that retransmit a {{party_name}} outside the Station’s D{{party_name}}, and that are carrying the Station’s analog signal as of the date of this {{party_name}}.

Any existing agreement between or among {{party_name}} and any one or more third parties applicable to such Station for the transmission of the {{party_name}} shall terminate and cease to be effective upon its acquisition by {{party_name}}. Any Acquired Station in a D{{party_name}} that is not transmitting the {{party_name}} at the time of acquisition by {{party_name}} shall likewise become a “Station” hereunder upon acquisition and shall commence transmitting the {{party_name}} within one hundred eighty ({{effective_date}} after the acquisition is consummated, unless, as provided in 3(a) above, (A) another {{party_name}} station in the same D{{party_name}} as {{party_name}} has exclusive rights to broadcast the {{party_name}}, or (B) {{party_name}} is obligated to broadcast other material that precludes it from also carrying the {{party_name}}.

If {{party_name}} changes the satellite, transponder or encryption method used to transmit the {{party_name}} and if the Receiving {{party_name}} or other existing equipment will not be suitable for receiving the {{party_name}} after the changes are implemented, with respect to such {{party_name}}), {{party_name}} agrees to furnish and install at its expense, or reimburse {{party_name}} for its reasonable cost of furnishing and installing, Receiving {{party_name}} suitable for receiving the {{party_name}} after the changes are implemented, without regard to the {{party_name}} Reimbursement Cap; provided, however, that with respect to new equipment made necessary by a satellite, transponder or encryption method change, which equipment may be used to receive the signals of other television services carried by such Station, {{party_name}} shall be obligated to reimburse {{party_name}} only for {{party_name}}’s pro-rata share of the cost of such equipment (based on the total number of television services being received by such affected {{party_name}} and utilizing such new equipment within ninety ({{effective_date}} of the effective date of such change). 7 Source: {{party_name}} MEDIA CORP., 8-K, {{effective_date}} (c) Each Station transmitting the {{party_name}} shall transmit a good-quality video and audio signal of the {{party_name}}, but in no event shall such Station be required to deliver a signal of a technical quality higher than the technical quality of the video and audio signal of the {{party_name}} as delivered by {{party_name}} hereunder.

Except for a Station’s {{party_name}} Time and Local {{party_name}}ming, station identification messages, and as except provided in 4(c) and 4(e) above, each Station shall transmit the {{party_name}} without alteration, editing or delay.

(f) Each Station that transmits the {{party_name}} may superimpose over the programming on the {{party_name}} a transparent station identification logo/“bug” that does not materially interfere with the {{party_name}} or any graphics or other data therein.
