(C) In the event that such weighted average sale price of the other API(s) in the {{party_name}} cannot be determined, but the weighted average sale price of the {{party_name}} component of the {{party_name}} can be determined, {{party_name}} shall be calculated by multiplying the {{party_name}} of the {{party_name}} by the fraction A/C, where A is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sales price of such {{party_name}} component as sold separately, and C is the weighted (by sales volume) average unit sales price of the {{party_name}}.

However, an {{party_name}}’s delay in providing or failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying {{party_name}} of its indemnification obligations, except to the extent it can demonstrate actual prejudice due to the delay or lack of notice. (b) Defense. Upon receipt of notice under this Section 13.3 from the {{party_name}}, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} will have the duty to either compromise or defend, at its own expense and by counsel (reasonably satisfactory to {{party_name}}) such {{party_name}}. The Indemnifying {{party_name}} will promptly (and in any event not more than twenty ({{effective_date}} after receipt of the {{party_name}}’s original notice) notify the {{party_name}} in writing that it acknowledges its obligation to indemnify the {{party_name}} with respect to the {{party_name}} pursuant to this Article 13 and of its intention either to compromise or defend such {{party_name}}. Once the Indemnifying {{party_name}} gives such notice to the {{party_name}}, the Indemnifying {{party_name}} is not liable to the {{party_name}} for the fees of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by the {{party_name}} in connection with such defense, other than the {{party_name}}’s reasonable out of pocket Third {{party_name}} expenses related to its investigation and cooperation, except as otherwise provided in the next sentence.

(c) Cooperation. The {{party_name}} shall reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying {{party_name}} and its legal representatives in the investigation and defense of any {{party_name}}.

(d) Settlement. If an Indemnifying {{party_name}} assumes the defense of a {{party_name}}, no compromise or settlement of such {{party_name}} may be effected by the Indemnifying {{party_name}} without the {{party_name}}’s written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the {{party_name}}’s consent shall not be required of a settlement where: (i) there is no finding or admission of any violation of law or any violation of the rights of any person and no effect on any other claims that may be made against the {{party_name}}; (ii) the sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the Indemnifying {{party_name}}; (iii) the {{party_name}}’s rights under this {{party_name}} are not adversely affected; and (iv) there is a full release of the {{party_name}} from such {{party_name}}.

It is understood that only {{party_name}} and {{party_name}} may claim indemnification under this {{party_name}} (on its own behalf or on behalf of its {{party_name}}s), and other {{party_name}}s may not directly claim indemnity under this {{party_name}}.
