Thereafter, this Agreement shall automatically be renewed for successive 1-year terms (each a "Renewal Term", and together with the Initial Term, the "Term").

Any purported assignment of rights in violation of this subsection is void. The relationship between the Parties is that of supplier and purchaser. Reseller is an independent contractor and is not the legal representative, agent, joint venture, partner, or employee of Supplier. Reseller may describe itself as Supplier's 'authorized distributor', but may not hold itself out as the Supplier's agent. Reseller has no authority to assume or create any obligations of any kind or to make any representations or warranties, whether express or implied, on behalf of the Supplier, nor to bind the Supplier in any respect.
