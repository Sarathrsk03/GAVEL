In addition, the Merchant and Agent shall be permitted to utilize exterior banners at (i) non- enclosed mall Stores and (ii) enclosed mall Stores to the extent the entrance to the applicable Store does not require entry into the enclosed mall common area; provided, however, that such banners shall be located or hung so as to make clear that the Sale is being conducted only at the affected Store Holdings, shall not be wider than the storefront of the Store, and shall not be larger than 4 feet x 40 feet. In addition the merchant and agent shall be permitted to utilize sign walkers in a safe and professional manner and in accordance with the terms of the approval order. Nothing contained in these Sale Guidelines shall be construed to create or impose upon Agent any additional restrictions not contained in the applicable lease agreement.
