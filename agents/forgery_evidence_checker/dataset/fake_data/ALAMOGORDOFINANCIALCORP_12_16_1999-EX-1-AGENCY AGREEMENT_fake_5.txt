               matters  of  law,  summaries  of  legal  matters,   documents  or                proceedings,  or legal  conclusions,  has been  reviewed  by such                counsel and is correct in all material  respects. The discussion                of  statutes  or  regulations  described  or  referred  to in the                Prospectus   are  accurate   summaries  and  fairly  present  the                information   required  to  be  shown. The  information  in  the                Prospectus relating to the tax consequences of the stock offering                has been  reviewed  by such  counsel  and  fairly  describes  the                opinions  rendered  by Luse Lehman  Gorman  Pomerenk & Schick and                _____________________  to the Company,  the MHC and the Bank with                respect to such matters. (xxiii) The  Company  and the MHC have been duly  registered                and are in good  standing as savings and loan  holding  companies                under the HOLA. (xxiv) In addition, such counsel shall state that during the                preparation of the MHC Application,  the  Registration  Statement                and the Prospectus, they participated in conferences with certain                officers of, the independent public and internal accountants for,                and other  representatives of the Company,  the MHC and the Bank,                at which  conferences  the contents of the MHC  Application,  the                Registration  Statement and the  Prospectus  and related  matters                were  discussed  and,  while such counsel have not  confirmed the                accuracy or completeness of or otherwise verified the information                contained in the MHC Application,  the Registration  Statement or                the  Prospectus,  and do not assume any  responsibility  for such                information,   based  upon  such  conferences  and  a  review  of                documents deemed relevant for the purpose of rendering their view                (relying as to materiality as to factual  matters on certificates                of officers and other factual representations by the Company, the                MHC and the Bank), nothing has come to their attention that would                lead them to believe that the MHC  Application,  the Registration                Statement, the Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto                (other than the  financial  statements,  the notes  thereto,  and                other tabular, financial, statistical and appraisal data included                therein as to which no view need be rendered) contained an untrue                statement of a material  fact or omitted to state a material fact                required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements                therein,  in light of the  circumstances  under  which  they were                made, not misleading. In giving such opinion such counsel may rely as to all matters of fact on  certificates  of officers or directors of the company  the mhc and the bank and certificates of public officials. The opinion of Luse Lehman Gorman Pomerenk & Schick  shall be  governed  by the  Legal  Opinion  Accord  ("Accord")  of the American  Bar  Association  Section of  Business  Law (1991). The term  "Actual Knowledge"  as used herein  shall have the meaning set forth in the Accord. For purposes of such opinion, no proceedings shall be deemed to be pending, no order or stop order shall be deemed to be issued,  and no action shall be deemed to be instituted unless, in each case, a director or executive officer of the company, the mhc or the bank shall have received a copy of such

                                       36

               company,  the mhc and the bank, or which would materially  affect                their properties and assets. (p)  The financial  statements,  schedules  and notes related  thereto                which  are  included  in  the   Prospectus   fairly  present  the                consolidated  balance  sheet,  income  statement,   statement  of                changes in equity  and cash  flows of the Bank at the  respective                dates  indicated and for the respective  periods  covered thereby                and  comply  as  to  form  in  all  material  respects  with  the                applicable  accounting  requirements  of  Title 12 of the Code of                Federal Regulations and generally accepted accounting  principles                (including  those  requiring the  recording of certain  assets at                their current market value). Such financial statements, schedules                and notes related  thereto have been prepared in accordance  with                generally accepted  accounting  principles  consistently  applied                through  the periods  involved,  present  fairly in all  material                respects the  information  required to be stated  therein and are                consistent  with the most recent  financial  statements and other                reports  filed by the Bank  with the OTS. The  other  financial,                statistical and pro forma  information and related notes included                in the Prospectus present fairly the information shown therein on                a basis  consistent  with the  audited  and  unaudited  financial                statements of the Bank included in the Prospectus,  and as to the                pro forma  adjustments,  the adjustments  described  therein have                been properly applied on the basis described therein. (q)  Since the  respective  dates as of which  information is given in                the Registration  Statement  including the Prospectus:  (i) there                has not been any material adverse change, financial or otherwise,                in the condition of the Company,  the MHC or the Bank  considered                as one enterprise,  or in the earnings,  capital or properties of                the Company,  the MHC or the Bank,  whether or not arising in the                ordinary course of business; (ii) there has not been any material                increase in the  long-term  debt of the Bank or in the  principal                amount of the Bank's  assets which are  classified by the Bank as                substandard,  doubtful  or loss or in  loans  past due 90 days or                more or real estate acquired by  foreclosure,  by deed-in-lieu of                foreclosure  or deemed  in-substance  foreclosure or any material                decrease in retained earnings or total assets of the Bank nor has                the  Company,  the MHC or the Bank issued any  securities  (other                than in  connection  with the  incorporation  of the  Company) or                incurred any liability or obligation for borrowing  other than in                the ordinary  course of  business; (iii) there have not been any                material transactions entered into by the Company, the MHC or the                Bank; (iv) there has not been any material  adverse change in the                aggregate   dollar   amount  of  the  Bank's   deposits   or  its                consolidated  net worth; (v) there has been no material  adverse                change in the  Company's,  the MHC's or the  Bank's  relationship                with  its  insurance  carriers,  including,  without  limitation,                cancellation or other termination of the Company's, the

               thereunder. (t)  upon  consummation of the offering  the  authorized  issued and                outstanding  equity  capital  of the  company  will be within the                range   set   forth  in  the   prospectus   under   the   caption                "capitalization"  and no shares  have been or will be issued and                outstanding  prior to the closing date (other than shares held by                the mhc); the Shares will have been duly and validly  authorized                for  issuance  and,  when  issued and  delivered  by the  Company                pursuant  to  the  Plan  against  payment  of  the  consideration                calculated as set forth in the Plan and in the  Prospectus,  will                be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable, except                for shares purchased by the ESOP with funds

(c)  the company,  the mhc and the bank will use their best efforts to                cause any post-effective  amendment to the registration statement                to be declared effective by the commission and any post-effective                amendment  to the mhc  application  to be approved by the ots and                will immediately  upon receipt of any information  concerning the                events listed below notify the agent:  (i) when the  registration                statement,  as amended,  has become effective; (ii) when the mhc                application,  as amended has been approved by the ots; (iii) any                comments from the Commission,  the OTS or any other  governmental                entity  with  respect  to  the   Offering  or  the   transactions                contemplated  by  this  Agreement; (iv)  of the  request  by the                Commission,  the OTS or any  other  governmental  entity  for any                amendment or supplement to the  Registration  Statement,  the MHC                Application or for additional information; (v) of the issuance by                the Commission,  the OTS or any other governmental  entity of any                order or other action  suspending  the Offering or the use of the                Registration  Statement or the  Prospectus or any other filing of                the Company,  the MHC or the Bank under the MHC  Regulations,  or                other applicable law, or the threat of any such action; (vi) the                issuance by the Commission,  the OTS or any authority of any stop                order suspending the effectiveness of the Registration  Statement                or of the  initiation  or threat of  initiation  or threat of any                proceedings  for that purpose; or (vii) of the occurrence of any                event mentioned in paragraph (g) below.

If an                indemnifying  party  assumes  the  defense  of such  action,  the                indemnifying  parties  shall  not be  liable  for  any  fees  and                expenses  of  counsel  for  the  indemnified   parties   incurred                thereafter in connection  with such action,  proceeding or claim,                other than reasonable costs
