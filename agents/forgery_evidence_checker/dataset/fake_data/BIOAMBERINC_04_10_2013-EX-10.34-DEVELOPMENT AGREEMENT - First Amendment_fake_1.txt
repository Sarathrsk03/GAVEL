TheBRIProjectwillbeco-funded by funds available from the Canadian National Research Council; Whereas, bioamber further desires to scale-up the production of succinic acid using a corynebacteria biocatalyst (mcc-17) available from  mitsubishi chemical corporation ("mcc") and to possibly produce succinic acid or salts using mcc-17 as an alternative to the e. coli BioAmber  has licensed from the DOE at: (1) Bioamber's existing demonstration-scale succinic acid production facility located at Pomacle, France; and (2) a  succinic acid production facility located at Sarnia, Ontario Canada having a maximum production capacity of  Holdings35,000 metric tons of succinic acid per  year (the "Sarnia Plant"). Together these scale Holdings-up projects will be referred to as the "Scale-up and Production Project"; WHEREAS, Cargill is willing to allow Bioamber to fund the BRI Project and to conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to the  following terms and conditions.

New Section 13.10 is added to the Development Agreement as set forth below:   "13.10 Notwithstanding the provisions of section 13.9, Bioamber may conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to Bioamber hereby  agreeing to convert the demonstration-scale Pomacle France succinic acid production facility and the Sarnia Plant to solely utilize CB1 as the  biocatalyst for the production of succinic acid (and/or salts thereof). This conversion will be carried out according to the provisions of section 5.9  of the commercial license, it being understood that all economic obligations of item (iv) above will be relative to the e. coli strain technology, not  the Mitsubishi strain technology. In order to enable such conversion bioamber will put in place agreements with the owners Holdings/operators of the  sarnia plant that will enable bioamber to require such conversion of the sarnia plant to solely use cb1 for the manufacture of succinic acid as  described above."
