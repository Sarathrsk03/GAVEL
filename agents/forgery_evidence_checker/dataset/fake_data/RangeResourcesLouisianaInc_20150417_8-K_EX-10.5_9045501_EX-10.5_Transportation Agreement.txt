  equal to the applicable Dedicated Rates, which shall initially be the rate(s) set forth in Schedule A attached hereto, and which shall be increased by Carrier annually, effective July 1 of each year following the Commencement Date, as provided in the Tariff ("Shipper's Dedicated Rates"). 6.2 Regulation Changes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event that, after the Effective Date, any Governmental Authority promulgates, issues or changes any rules, regulations or other mandates that impose any material fee, charge or cost upon Carrier in connection with the performance of the Services performed hereunder, excluding normal fees, charges or costs that are incurred by Carrier irrespective of whether Carrier provides the Services on behalf of Shipper and excluding Taxes addressed in Article XVII, then Carrier may increase the then-effective Shipper's Dedicated Rates by up to ten percent (10%) to account for such fees, charges or costs (to the extent such fees, charges or costs are attributable to Shipper Product); provided, however, the cumulative effect of all such increases pursuant to this Section 6.2 may not exceed thirty percent (30%) of the initial Shipper's Dedicated Rates (as the same may be adjusted pursuant to the Tariff from time to time). If, in Carrier's reasonable judgment, an increase in Shipper's Dedicated Rates of more than ten percent (10%) would be required to place Carrier in substantially the same economic position as it was in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges or costs, Carrier may call for a meeting among the Parties' senior management to take place within thirty (30) Days of written notice to Shipper, and the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to amend the provisions of this Agreement such that the Parties are in substantially the same relative economic position as they were in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges or costs. If the Parties are unable to agree on an economic adjustment within sixty (60) Days of the senior management meeting, then Carrier may, in its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement without penalty by delivering Shipper written notice of Carrier's intent to terminate. Such termination shall be effective at the option of shipper (i) as of 9:00 a.m. On the first day of the month which follows the month that carrier delivered its notice of intent to terminate, or (ii) as of 9:00 a.m. on the first Day of the Month which is twelve (12) Months after such date, provided that Shipper's Dedicated Rates for such twelve (12) Month period before such termination shall be increased to place Carrier in substantially the same economic position as it was in prior to the imposition or assessment of such fees, charges, or costs. Shipper shall exercise such option by delivery of written notice to Carrier of Shipper's election within ten (10) Business Days of receipt of Carrier's notice to terminate, provided that if Shipper has not responded to Carrier by the time described in clause (i) above, the Agreement shall continue pursuant to clause (ii) above. Shipper shall be entitled to audit carrier's applicable books and records for the limited purpose of determining if the amount of any increase pursuant to this section 6.2 is justified by the actually-incurred and reasonable amount of the aggregate costs and/or expenses relating to the system; provided, however, such audit shall not require Carrier to disclose confidential information of any Person other than Shipper who is a shipper on the System. If such audit shall reflect that such increase was not justifiable in accordance with the foregoing, Carrier shall promptly credit the amount of such discrepancy to Shipper, unless Carrier disagrees with the results of such audit, in which case the matter shall be resolved pursuant to the dispute resolution provisions set forth in Article XII hereof. 6.3 Governmental Modifications. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Parties acknowledge that the Tariff rates payable for all Services are subject to the approval of and modification by the FERC or any other Governmental Authority having jurisdiction. 7

g. Carrier is not responsible for monitoring receipts or deliveries for contaminants. Further, Carrier reserves the right to dispose of any contaminated Product on the System. Disposal thereof may be made in any reasonable manner including but not limited to commercial sales. Any liability associated with the contamination or disposal of any products shall be borne by shipper introducing the contaminated products into the system. Shipper liability includes, but is not limited to, claims from other Shippers, carriers, or users of the contaminated Products and the costs of any regulatory or judicial proceeding. H. If Product received by Carrier does not meet the quality specifications set forth in this Item No. 3, Carrier reserves the right to charge the Shipper the greater of (i) the actual costs and expenses incurred by Carrier to treat, handle, or otherwise dispose of all such contaminated Product, or (ii) a one-hundred (100) cents per Barrel charge for the volume of contaminated Product transported by Shipper ("Off-Spec Penalty"). If a composite sample, spot sample, or the results of any other test demonstrates that a shipper's product delivered to carrier fails to meet the quality specifications set forth in this item no. 3, the total penalty will be assessed by multiplying the Off-Spec Penalty by the total volume of Shipper's Product (in barrels) received by Carrier during the ticket period when Carrier received the contaminated Product. 4. IDENTITY OF PRODUCTS:

a. Product for shipment through the System will be received only on a properly executed Nomination from Shipper or its designee showing the Receipt Point at which the Product is to be received, the Delivery Point of the shipment, Consignee (if any), and the amount of Product to be transported. Carrier may refuse to accept product for transportation unless satisfactory evidence is furnished that shipper or consignee has made provision for prompt receipt thereof at the delivery point. Carrier shall not be obligated to accept Product for transportation during any calendar month, unless Shipper or its designee makes such Nomination to Carrier in writing on or before 9:00 a.m., prevailing Central Time of the tenth (10t h) Business Day immediately preceding the first day of the month during which the transportation under the Nomination is to begin. 7

FERC ICA OIL TARIFF F.E.R.C. No. 1.0.0

  B. Carrier may refuse to accept Product for transportation where Shipper or Consignee is not in compliance with other provisions of this Tariff or where Shipper or Consignee has failed to comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations made by any governmental authorities regulating shipments of Products. C. Unless shipper and carrier have agreed otherwise in a tsa, carrier reserves the right to control in its discretion the component distribution in the product tendered by shipper or its designee, in order to achieve maximum operating efficiency of carrier's facilities and optimum utilization of total transportation capacity. Carrier shall use reasonable judgment in exercising that discretion. D. The rate at which product is delivered to carrier and redelivered from carrier will be determined by carrier's transportation and redelivery obligations to its shippers and by the necessity of economical use and efficient operation of carrier's facilities, which shall be determined by carrier in the exercise of its reasonable judgment. Carrier will assume no liability for its inability to maintain schedules or comply with Shipper's redelivery requests when caused by operational or scheduling problems, excess demand, delays and other problems encountered in pipeline operations. 6. NOMINATIONS IN EXCESS OF CAPACITY:

When there is offered to Carrier quantities of Product greater than can be transported on the System, Carrier shall allocate the available transportation capacity on the System ("Available Capacity"). Allocation will be given as a daily or monthly volume, at Carrier's discretion, and will be calculated for the calendar month. New shippers will have access to a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the available capacity and historical shippers will have access to a maximum of ninety percent (90%) of the available capacity. Carrier shall allocate up to ninety percent (90%) of the Available Capacity on a non-discriminatory historical basis to all Historical Shippers. Each individual Historical Shipper's entitlement will be based on (i) the average monthly volumes of the Historical Shipper's Representative Period, based on the greater of the volumes transported or paid for during each month of the Representative Period or (ii) for an Incentive Shipper, based on the Incentive Shipper's Committed Volume on a yearly basis. The remaining ten percent (10%) of the available capacity shall be allocated on a prorata basis to new shippers. Carrier is not required to allocate more than two percent (2%) of the Available Capacity to any individual New Shipper. The Carrier will repeat this allocation process until all of the Available Capacity has been allocated. Allocation will not be transferred. With agreement of the Shippers concerned, historical volume will be transferred under the following conditions:

  •   No commercial transaction occurs between the participating shippers with regard to historical volumes. •   The transfer is irrevocable. •   The request to transfer must be the result of an unusual situation as may be reasonably determined by Carrier. 8

FERC ICA OIL TARIFF F.E.R.C. No. 1.0.0   For the purposes of this Item No. 6:

Products of the required specifications shall be Tendered for transportation in quantities of not less than 2,500 Barrels of the same specification, except that Carrier may, in its sole discretion, accept any quantity of Product if such quantity can be consolidated with other Product such that Carrier can make a single delivery of not less than 2,500 Barrels. The term "single delivery" as used herein means a delivery of product in one continuous operation to one or more consignees into a single facility, furnished by such consignee or consignees, to which carrier is connected. 8. Measurement and evidence of receipts and deliveries:

a. Carrier or its representative will measure and test all Product Tendered for transportation prior to its receipt and may measure and test such Product at any time thereafter. Shipper or Consignee may be present or represented at the gauging and testing. Quantities shall be determined in accordance with applicable A.P.I. Manual of Petroleum Measurement Standards and applicable Gas Processors Association procedures. B. Any overage or shortage not due to the negligence of Carrier, including losses resulting from shrinkage, evaporation, other physical Product loss and interface mixture in any calendar month, will be allocated on a monthly accrual basis among Shippers in the proportion that the total number of Barrels delivered from the entire System for each Shipper bears to the total number of Barrels delivered from the entire System for all Shippers. C. Carrier may require shipper to furnish a certificate setting forth in detail the specification of each shipment of product offered for transportation hereunder and shipper shall be liable for any contamination or damage to other product in carrier's custody or to the system or other carrier facilities caused by failure of the product tendered to meet the specifications stated in shipper's certification. Carrier may, but shall not be required to, sample and/or test any shipment prior to acceptance or during receipt of shipment, and, in the event of variance between the specifications contained in said certificate and the specifications indicated by Carrier's test, Carrier's test result shall prevail and be used to determine whether the shipment meets Carrier's specifications. Shipper or consignee may be present or represented at such measuring and testing. D. A representative of Carrier shall have the right to enter upon the premises where Shipper's Product is received or delivered and have access to any and all storage receptacles or meters for the purposes of measuring and testing and to make any examination, inspection, measurement or test required. E. All measurements and tests performed by Carrier shall be deemed final and determinative unless Shipper presents appropriatedocumentation to contest such measurements and/or tests within forty-five (45) days of receipt. 9

Unless otherwise agreed in a TSA between Carrier and Shipper, the cost of such facilities shall be provided at the sole cost of Shipper seeking access to the System. 12. NOTICE OF ARRIVAL, DELIVERY AT DESTINATION:

After a shipment has had time to arrive at destination, Carrier may begin delivery of such shipment from its common stock to Shipper or Consignee at Carrier's current rate of pumping.
