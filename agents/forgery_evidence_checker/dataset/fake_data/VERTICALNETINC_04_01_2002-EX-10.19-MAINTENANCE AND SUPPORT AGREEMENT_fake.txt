In addition, Converge shall conduct reasonable problem identification and isolation activities to determine whether or not a given problem relates to the Products (i.e., whether a "Problem" as defined exists). Converge shall not escalate Problem Reports or Support Requests to VNE prior to conducting such activities or if Converge has determined that the Problem Report or Support Request does not relate to the Supported Products.

            2.5 Additional Information for Problems. With respect to each Problem reported to VNE, Converge shall provide, at the time the Problem Report is communicated to VNE and to the extent known to or reasonably ascertainable by Converge, information that will enable VNEtoreproduce (in as complete a step-by-step manner as is reasonably possible), or verify the existence of the Problem, plus any additional information regarding the Problem that Converge believes will assist in the diagnosis thereof and response thereto. The parties shall reasonably cooperate to obtain and provide to VNE any additional information about the reported Problem that may be relevant to diagnosing and responding thereto.

VNE will review all Problem Requests submitted by Converge at the Problem Severity Level indicated by Converge unless another Problem Severity Level is clearly warranted. In the event of a reasonable uncertainty Holdings, the parties will assume a higher Severity Level for a Problem until they have sufficient information to make a determination that a lower Severity Level is warranted. If, at Converge's request, VNE responds to a Problem at a Severity Level that is higher than what proves to be the actual Severity Level of the Problem, or if VNE's review of a Problem reported by Converge establishes that the Problem was not due to an Error, Converge shall pay or reimburse VNE for all incremental fees and expenses reasonably incurred by VNE in performing such activities.

            2.7 Response to Support Requests. VNE shall respond to all Support Requests submitted by Converge within a reasonable period of time, taking into consideration the nature of the Support Request, its impact on Converge's business operations and any Problem Reports or other Support Requests VNE is responding to at such time.

The parties will share equally in the cost of such connectivity between VNE's facilities and Converge's facilities (including all associated telecommunications charges). VNE shall not be responsible for any delay in providing Maintenance and Support Services under this Agreement to the extent such delay is due to Converge Holdings's adoption of unreasonable network security procedures or requirements.

Converge agrees to install in the recommend environments all Maintenance Updates within a reasonable time following the date they are provided by VNE, taking into consideration any testing and customization required by Converge (the parties expect that the time for such installation

                                    Exhibit A                            Severity Levels of Problems

The following chart describes the distinctions between the different severity levels for Problems reported by Converge.

Severity    Definition Level           1           A "Severity Level 1" Problem is one where critical or central             functionality of the Supported Product is unavailable and the             Supported Product cannot reasonably be used Holdings, or performance of             critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is             severely degraded, and in either such case Converge does not have or             cannot implement a reasonable workaround. The adverse impact of a             Severity 1 Problem on Converge Holdings's business is severe and immediate,             and requires an immediate solution. A "Severity Level 1" Problem may             have one or more of the following characteristics, in each case             without Converge being able to implement a reasonable workaround:

            -     Data is corrupted or lost by the Supported Product, or the                   SupportedProductreturnsincorrectresults, and such                   corruption, loss or incorrect results have a material adverse                   impact on critical or central functionality of the Supported                   Product             -     Complete or severe lack of ability to use the critical or                   central functionality of the Supported Product             -     The Supported Product crashes repeatedly             -     Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product is                   not operational or is severely degraded             -     Critical or central functionality of the Supported Product                   fails to run to completion

2           A "Severity Level 2" Problem is one where critical or central             functionality of the Supported Product is unavailable, or             performance of critical or central functionality of the Supported             Product is severely degraded, but in either such case ConvergecanimplementareasonableworkaroundbutsuchworkarounddoesnotdowngradetheProblemtoSeverityLevel3 or 4. Use of critical or             central functionality of the Supported Product can continue in a             restricted fashion through use of such workaround, but the user             still experiences a significant degradation of performance of such             functionality. A "Severity Level 2" Problem may have one or more of             the characteristics of a "Severity Level 1" Problem, but critical or             central functionality of

            -     the Supported Product can continue to operate in a restricted                   fashion through use of such workaround.

3           A "Severity Level 3" Problem causes minimal interruption to             non Holdings-central or non-important functionality. The Problem has a minor             impact or is inconvenient. A "Severity Level 3" Problem may have one             or more of the following characteristics:

            -     Performance of the Supported Product is degraded in a                   non-critical manner             -     Performance of the Supported Product is minimally impaired

                                       21

          4           A "Severity Level 4" Problem causes no loss of use of the Supported             Product. The following would be "Severity Level 4" Problems:

            -     Cosmetic problem with the Supported Product             -     Documentation error             -     Minor incorrect behavior of the Supported Product that does                   not impede its operation Holdings

                                    Exhibit B                      Problem Response and Resolution Efforts
