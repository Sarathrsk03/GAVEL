Equitable Relief. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event of an alleged violation of Article 9 of this Agreement by either Party, the Party alleging such a violation may seek temporary and permanent injunctive or other appropriate equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction pending appointment of an arbitrator. The Party requesting such relief shall simultaneously file a demand for arbitration of the dispute, and shall request that the AAA proceed under its rules for an expedited hearing. 8.4. Costs. Unless the arbitrator, if any, determines otherwise, each Party will bear its own attorneys' fees and other costs associated with the negotiation and arbitration provided for by this Article 8, except that costs and expenses of the arbitrator shall be shared equally. If court proceedings to stay litigation or compel arbitration are necessary, the Party who unsuccessfully initiates or opposes such proceedings will pay all associated costs, expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred by the other Party. To the extent that any claim in arbitration relates to the collection of amounts owed under Article 6, the Party entitled to collect such amounts shall be entitled to recover all reasonable costs of collection, including expenses and attorneys' fees that are reasonably incurred. 8.5. Two Year Limitation. Except for claims under sections 11.4  [indemnification by leadersonline] and 11.5  [indemnification by verticalnet] hereof, neither party may bring a claim or action regardless of form, arising out of or related to
