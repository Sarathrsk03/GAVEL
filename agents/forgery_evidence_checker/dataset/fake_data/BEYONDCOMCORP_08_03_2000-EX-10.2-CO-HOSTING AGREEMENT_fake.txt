                           distribution addendum

  whereas, nai owns and/or markets certain computer software and hardware products set forth on exhibit "a" ("products"). WHEREAS, Co-Host is an independent reseller of computer products to end users ordering products through web sites on the Internet operated by Co-Host. Whereas, co-host distributes electronic copies of the products pursuant to the esd agreement. Whereas co-host desires to distribute the products and nai desires to make the products available to co-host for further distribution. THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, and of the mutual covenants and agreements hereinafter set forth, NAI and Co-Host enter into the following additional agreements regarding the Products:

1. APPOINTMENT. Nai appoints co-host as a non-exclusive distributor of the      products to end users ordering the products from the destination or the      co-host site and co-host accepts this appointment. Co-Host shall      distribute the Products, as an independent reseller, at its own risk and      expense and subject to any such prices, contractual terms and conditions as      Co-Host may from time to time determine. Nothing in this Agreement shall      prohibit Co-Host from distributing competing products in the Territory. The      "Territory" as that term is used herein shall mean all countries in the      world except countries to which export or re-export of any Product, or the      direct products of any Product is prohibited by United States law without      first obtaining the permission of the United States Office of Export      Administration or its successor. Co-host shall not have the right to assign      or otherwise transfer this agreement or any rights herein granted to any      other person or entity, except by operation of law or in connection with      the sale of all of its assets, or the acquisition of the co-host by a third      party. Any such attempted assignment shall be void and the Agreement shall      remain in effect. 2. DISTRIBUTION. Co-Host has the right to market and distribute the Products      subject to the license agreement that accompanies such Product. Co-host may

  not engage in the rental of any of the products. Co-host shall not in any      event remove from or obscure upon any products any labels placed thereon by      nai containing statements of restrictions upon distribution, without the      prior written consent of nai. NAI reserves the right in its sole discretion      and without liability to Co-Host to add additional Products, change the      prices for the Products pursuant to Section 5, modify the Products, change      the level of NAI's support for the Products and discontinue the      availability of any Product. Any addition or deletion from the list of      Products will be indicated by NAI's revision to the NAI price list, and NAI      will use reasonable efforts to provide Co-Host with thirty (30) days notice      prior to the effective date of such changes indicated on the NAI price      list. 2    17

3. MARKETING. (a)  general. Co-Host will use commercially reasonable efforts to market           the Products it orders to the best of its ability, and to that end           will (i) conduct marketing activities authorized by NAI, (ii) support           special promotions initiated by NAI, and (iii) maintain a sound           financial condition. Co-Host will conduct its business in a manner           that reflects favorably upon the Products and NAI. (b)  Advertising; Use of Trademarks. Co-Host may advertise and promote the           Products in a commercially reasonable manner and, subject to the           provisions of Section 5 of the Co-Hosting Agreement, may use           trademarks, service marks and trade names provided by NAI in           connection therewith, provided that all such promotions and           advertising will be consistent with NAI's general quality standards           and the provisions of Section 5 of the Co-Hosting Agreement. Unless           otherwise agreed upon in writing by NAI, Co-Host will submit each           advertisement and promotion to NAI for trademark review and approval           prior to initial release, which approval will not be unreasonably           delayed or withheld. All such usage which was not expressly approved           by nai must be terminated immediately upon receipt of notice from nai           to that effect. (c)  Trademarks Rights. NAI owns any and all trademarks, trade names, and           service marks for the Products (as noted in Section 5 of the           Co-Hosting Agreement). Such trademarks, trade names, and service marks           shall include all product names, the names "network associates,"           logos, designs, and other designations or brands used by nai in           connection with the products. Co-Host acknowledges and agrees that NAI           is not granting to Co-Host any rights in any Product trademark, trade           name, or service mark in or outside of the Territory. 4. Inspections records and reporting. (a)  Sales Out Reports. Co-Host will provide to NAI within ten (10) days           after the end of each calendar month, a computer media data file in           the format established by NAI showing, for such month, Co-Host's total           sales, by customer and by Product from each location. If requested by           NAI, Co-Host shall provide such reports with respect to weekly periods           or bi-weekly periods prior to the end of the calendar month in which           such period occurs. (b)  inventory level reports. Co-host will provide to nai on monday of each           week, a computer media data file in the format established by nai           showing co-host's current inventory levels of each product (including           items in transit), and weekly runrate snapshots and the other           information reasonably requested by nai. (c)  Records. For three (3) years after each calendar quarter during the           term of this Agreement, Co-Host will keep, at Co-Host's office, full           and accurate books of account and copies of all documents and other           materials for such quarter relating to this Agreement and Co-Host's           records, accounts and contracts relating to the distribution of the           Products. (d)  audit. NAI may inspect the records described in Sections 4(c) upon           demand from time to time. In addition, Co-Host agrees to allow NAI's           independent auditors to audit and analyze appropriate accounting           records of Co-Host from time to time (but not more than one every six           (6) months) to ensure compliance with all terms of this Agreement. Any           such audit shall be permitted by Co-Host within fifteen (15) days of           Co-Host's receipt of NAI's written request to audit, during normal           business hours. The cost of such an audit will be borne by NAI unless           a material discrepancy indicating inadequate record keeping or that           additional fees due to NAI are discovered, in which case the cost of           the audit shall be borne by Co-Host. A discrepancy shall be deemed           material if it involves payment or adjustment of more than five           percent of the amount reported in favor of nai. Audits and inspections           shall not interfere unreasonably with Co-Host's business activities.]

5. ORDERING AND PAYMENT. (a)  NAI's Acceptance. Any order for delivery of physical product placed

       with NAI is subject to acceptance by NAI within ten (10) days           following receipt by NAI. NAI may decline any order, in whole or in           part, and unless NAI accepts an order in writing, the order is           considered accepted only to the extent it is fulfilled.] The terms and           conditions of this Agreement and of the applicable NAI invoice or           confirmation will apply to each order accepted or shipped by NAI. Electronic confirmation from an authorized NAI email address shall           have the same effect as a signed written confirmation. The provisions           of Co-Host's form of purchase order or other business forms will not           apply to any order notwithstanding NAI's acknowledgment or acceptance           of such order. (b)  price to co-host. Nai will inform co-host as to its current suggested           retail price of the products and standard discount or pricing granted           to nai's traditional product distributors. During the term of this           Agreement, Co-Host will be invoiced on the basis of the discounts set           forth on Exhibit "A" of this Distribution Addendum. Discounts off           suggested retail price (SRP) for standard NAI Products shall exclude           tradeups, upgrade SKUs and special promotions, unless otherwise           indicated. Nai may change its srp from time to time upon written           notice to co-host, which may take the form of a revised price list,           and nai may notify co-host of a different discount from srp in the           event nai offers special promotional srps or product prices in nai's           discretion. (c)  Price Increase. If NAI increases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product) and there is a resulting increase in the price of           Products to Co-Host, NAI will give Co-Host thirty (30) days advance           notice of the effective date of any such increase and:

       (i)  NAI will honor the old price for any shipments of such Product                already in transit to Co-Host; 4    19

       (ii) All additional orders following such thirty (30) day period will                be shipped at the new price; (iii) nai has orders for such product from co-host already booked into                nai's order entry system at the time of such price increase or if                co-host orders additional products during such thirty (30) day                period, then the price increase will not apply to that portion of                such orders which call for shipments of not more than the monthly                average quantity of such products shipped to co-host in the three                month period preceding the date of the increase; and

       (iv) Orders for such Product in NAI's order entry system in excess of                the quantity specified in (iii) above will be shipped at the new                price unless they are canceled by Co-Host by written notice to                NAI, provided that such notice is received by NAI no later than                fifteen (15) days prior to the date of shipment specified in such                order. (d)  Price Decrease. If NAI decreases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product), the decrease will apply to all units of such           Product in Co-Host's inventory and orders in transit to Co-Host from           NAI that are in an unopened, salable condition as of the effective           date of the decrease, provided that such Products had been shipped to           Co-Host no more than ninety (90) days prior to such effective date. To           be eligible for such price protection, Co-Host must deliver to NAI           written evidence, signed by Co-Host, of an inventory of such Products           showing the number and location of each unit of Product for which           Co-Host claims price protection eligibility hereunder within thirty           (30) days of receiving notice of such price decreases. Such reduction           will constitute a credit on Co-Host's account for future orders from           NAI under this Agreement (unless the Agreement has terminated or           expired in which case such reduction will be refunded to the extent           that Co-Host does not owe NAI money) in an amount equal to the           difference between the net invoice price at which each such unit in           inventory was provided to Co-Host and the current price then           applicable for shipments of such Product to Co-Host hereunder. (e)  TAXES. (i)  All amounts payable by Co-Host to NAI under this Agreement are                exclusive of any tax, withholding tax, levy, or similar                governmental charge that may be assessed by any jurisdiction in                or outside the Territory except income and similar taxes levied                on and payable by NAI. Such taxes withholding taxes levies and                governmental charges (collectively "taxes") include taxes based                on sales use excise import or export values/fees value-added                income revenue net worth or may be the result of the delivery                possession or use of the products the execution or performance                of this agreement or otherwise. Should any Taxes be due, Co-Host                agrees to pay such Taxes and indemnify NAI for any claim for

                                    5    20

            such Taxes demanded. Co-host shall make no deduction from any                amounts owed to nai for any taxes. Co-Host covenants to NAI that                all Products distributed hereunder will be in the ordinary course                of Co-Host's business, and Co-Host agrees to provide NAI with                appropriate information and/or documentation satisfactory to the                applicable taxing authorities to substantiate any claim of                exemption from any Taxes. (ii) for all taxes paid by co-host, co-host shall provide to nai                within forty-five (45) days after the end of any quarter, a                certificate of tax payment documenting the payment and amount of                the taxes paid during the preceding quarter. 6. SHIPMENT, RISK OF LOSS AND DELIVERY. (b)  risk of loss. All risk of loss of or damage to the products will pass           to co-host upon delivery by nai to the common carrier. Co-host will           bear the risk of loss or damage in transit. (c)  partial delivery. Unless Co-Host clearly advises NAI to the contrary           in writing NAI, may make partial shipments on account of Co-Host's           orders which shall, to be separately invoiced and paid for when due. (a)  returned merchandise authorization. Notwithstanding anything to the           contrary herein contained, NAI will not issue credit to nor be           obligated to accept returns for any reason for any physical Products           unless NAI shall have previously issued a written Return Merchandise           Authorization ("RMA"). The preceding sentence governs whether or not           NAI is obligated to issue an RMA under this Agreement or applicable           law. RMAs must be in writing, signed by NAI and only authorize the           return of Products in good resalable conditions unless expressly           provided otherwise herein. If damaged goods are received pursuant to           an rma, no credit shall be given by nai with respect to such damaged           goods unless the rma indicates otherwise. Co-host shall be responsible           for all freight charges for goods returned pursuant to an rma unless           otherwise indicated herein or in the rma. (b)  Customer Returns and Bad Box. Subject to section 7 (a) co-host may           during the term of this agreement obtain a credit against current or           future invoices from

                                    6    21

       nai for products which have been returned by end users as defective           or pursuant to the warranty stated in nai's end user license. Such           credit will be in an amount equal to the original invoice price less           any discounts or other credits previously received. Co-Host shall also           have the ability to return for credit Products which have boxes that           are or become damaged, unless such damage was caused by Co-Host. An           offsetting purchase order must be placed for all bad box returns. In           the event of claims by end users of incomplete Product, NAI, at its           discretion, may supply to Co-Host, at no charge, any and all missing           materials which are supposed to be provided with the current release           of such Products or replace the entire Products in such situation. 8. GENERAL. (a)  co-host agrees that it will not, directly or indirectly, export or           transmit the product and technical data (or any part thereof) or any           process or service that is the direct product of the software and           documentation, to any group s or z country specified in supplement no. 1 of Section 770 of the Export Administration Regulations or to any           other country to which such export or transmission is restricted by           such regulation or statute, without the prior written consent, if           required, of the Office of Export Administration of the U.S. Department of commerce, or such other governmental entity as may have           jurisdiction over such export or transmission. 7    22
