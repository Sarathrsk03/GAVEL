Application Provider will not be required, in the course of providing           such consulting services to Excite@Home, to disclose or transfer to           Excite@Home any proprietary information, software, or Intellectual           Property of Application Provider or any of its merchant partners. iv)  To further ensure a seamless transition for Program Members, in the           event of a termination based upon a material breach by e-centives or           an acquisition pursuant to Section 16.a.v. only, Application Provider           shall continue to host and maintain the Co-Branded Application for a           period of one hundred twenty (120) days following either receipt or           issuance of notice of intention to terminate this Agreement. Such           hosting and maintenance of the co-branded application shall be           provided by application provider at such reasonable rates as are           mutually agreed upon by the parties. v)   The provisions of this Section (Termination), Section 17           (Post-Termination Communications), Section 18 (Confidentiality),           Section 19 (Warranties and Indemnities), Section 20 (Limitation of           Liability), and Section 21 (Dispute Resolution) shall survive any           termination or expiration of this Agreement. 19 *****Confidential Treatment has been requested for portions of this agreement.

  a)   upon termination of this agreement for reasons other than a           relationship with an excite@home named competitor under section           16.a.v. the parties will communicate with program members as follows:

       i)   excite@home will email program members on e-centives' behalf up                to a maximum of two times. Consistent with other communications                envisioned during the Term of the Agreement, such mailings will                be branded Excite@Home but will alert Program Members that this                Agreement is to be terminated, the Co-Branded Application will

            continue with e-centives branding, and Program Members will                continue as a participant in the e-centives service unless they                explicitly opt out. The content and copy of such emails shall be                mutually agreed upon. ii)  The first email will be exclusive to e-centives (i.e., it will                not mention similar services from Excite@Home or other third                parties) and will alert Program Members of the continuation of                the e-centives service directly from e-centives. Program Members                shall be further alerted that their membership in the e-centives                service shall continue unless they explicitly opt-out. Excite@home shall not promote competing services in such contact                or otherwise discourage program members from continuing to use                the e-centives service as provided directly by e-centives. iii) The second email will not be exclusive to e-centives. It will                include the same e-centives alerts as in the first email, but may                offer a replacement Excite@Home service and a notification that                the Program Member will remain in such an Excite@Home-provided                service unless they specifically opt-out. Excite@home shall not                discourage program members from continuing to use the e-centives                service directly from e-centives but may offer an additional                choice. It is conceivable that any one end user customer could                use both services. Iv)  any such communications will be subject to excite@home's                then-current privacy policy. B)   in the event that the agreement is terminated pursuant to section           16.a.v. Due to e-centives' acquisition by an excite@home named           competitor or by an entity controlling or controlled by an           excite@home named competitor e-centives or its assigns or designates           may not contact any users for whom user data has been provided           pursuant to this agreement excluding those that have opted out in           accordance with section 5(a) of exhibit d. In the event of such           termination, e-centives will not be eligible for any refund of           pre-termination payments made to Excite@Home. 19

  a)   Until offer selection is made, branding shall be, at Excite@Home's           option, "Excite" or "Excite@Home" with a tag line "powered by           e-centives."

  b)   When offer management or redemption occurs, "Excite (or alternately,           Excite@Home, as detailed in Section 3.a of this Exhibit) powered by           e-centives" shall be replaced by cobranding, including full logo           treatment for e-centives. For any branding at the merchant subject to           final merchant approval, e-centives shall use commercially reasonable           efforts to ensure that both Excite@Home and e-centives branding           elements are present. c)   Both traditional e-centives offers and Excite@Home e-centives offers           will contain e-centives branding elements within an application that           is otherwise Excite@Home branded. d)   The Co-Branded Application shall conform to Excite@Home Third-Party           Application standards, including:

       i)   Page weight; ii)  Presence of advertising banners and/or sponsorship placements                served by Excite@Home/MatchLogic at Excite@Home's exclusive                option; iii) Color, fonts, layout, design standards, header, footer,                navigational elements, tabbing metaphors, etc.; Iv)  navigational elements directing traffic to non-e-centives content                (e.g. excite@home mail and other excite@home shopping                destinations); v)   Excite@Home's Third-Party Application Standards may change over                the Term of this Agreement. As they do, e-centives may be                required to make periodic design enhancements to comply with                these Standards. Any such required changes shall be reasonable                and shall be materially similar to changes required of other                applications and application providers subject to Excite@Home's                Third-Party Application Standards. e)   The Co-Branded Application shall be designed to appear to the customer           as being Excite@Home; Analogs to the goal would be excite@home's           sports content area at http://www.excite.com/sports, as it appears on           the effective date of this agreement (see exhibit c), which is served           by a third-party firm but carries only excite@home messaging cues. 31

6. OFFER HIERARCHY SYNCHRONIZATION

  a)   e-centives does not need to adopt Excite@Home's directory structure           but must use similar categorization methodology. For example, Autos           and Electronics may be categories at the same level in the hierarchy,           but Autos and Cameras would not be at the same level. b)   e-centives must map to Excite@Home's Shopping directory hierarchy,           which may change from time to time during the Term of this Agreement. c)   e-centives must adopt Excite@Home's naming conventions (e.g. Excite@Home's "Autos" label vs. e-centives' "Automotive" label). D)   e-centives must provide product and/or offer search capabilities that           are comparable to excite network offerings, including local (zip           code) and off-line redemption. Any such required capabilities shall           be reasonable and shall be materially similar to capabilities           required of other applications and application providers subject to           Excite@Home's Third-Party Application Standards. 7. Placement

  a)   during the first year of the agreement a persistent "above-the-fold"           link shall remain present in the excite@home shopping content area           or its subsequent replacement or an equivalent area as determined by           excite@home that directs end users to the co-branded application           the phrasing of which shall be mutually agreed upon. "Above-the-Fold"           shall mean in a position generally viewable by an end-user customer           using an Internet browser which has been maximized to full screen on           a computer displaying a minimum resolution of 600 x 800 dpi or higher. B)   during the remainder of the agreement, a prominent and persistent           link shall remain present in the excite@home shopping content area,           or its subsequent replacement, or an equivalent area as determined by           excite@home, that directs end users to the co-branded application.

 a)  This Section applies to the publicly accessible narrowband offering from         Excite@Home, currently available at http://www.excite.com. B)  excite@home intends to use a randomization function to surface offers on         mesp in order to provide category specification by user and to support         dynamic content delivery for each server-refreshed page view.
