Theravance will provide two (2) Theravance New Compounds to the collaboration within eighteen (18) months of the Effective Date in order to meet the requirement that Theravance contribute a total of four (4) LABA compounds to the Pooled Compounds. Without prejudice to the foregoing, GSK will endeavor to provide Theravance, upon Theravance's request and at GSK's expense and discretion, such assistance as may be reasonably required by Theravance to achieve this objective, including providing directly or through GSK's vendors, assistance in (i) chemical process development, (ii) salt selection, (iii) pharmaceutical formulation, (iv) toxicological evaluation, and (v) API preparation. 4.2 obligations for development. 4.2.1 General; GSK. Under the direction of the Joint Project Committee, specific Pooled Compounds will be identified from time to time and, as applicable, selected for Development as a Collaboration Product. The Joint Project Committee will determine the number and extent of Development of the Pooled Compounds and the criteria to be used for selecting among the eight Pooled Compounds and, subject to the other terms of this Agreement, will endeavor to move one or more such Collaboration Products forward in Development. In   17





  relation to the foregoing, gsk shall have the overall responsibility for, and use diligent efforts in, the performance of all such development activities which shall include, where applicable, relevant regulatory filings (as contemplated under article 8) for any such collaboration product moved forward in development. Further, GSK shall use Diligent Efforts to advance such Collaboration Product through Development in accordance with the Go/No-Go checkpoints identified in the then current Development Plan for such Collaboration Product. GSK shall also use Diligent Efforts to contribute at least one ICS and/or other non-LABA compound to the collaboration for the purpose of developing a combination product and Diligent Efforts to develop an optimal inhaled formulation of Collaboration Product in a device which may be either/or a dry powder inhaler formulation and/or a metered dose inhaler formulation of the Collaboration Compound and Development activities of such may continue in parallel. 4.2.2 gsk funding responsibility. GSK shall bear all costs and expenses associated with the Development of Collaboration Products for Commercialization including those incurred by Theravance (or to which it has become obligated) after the signature date of this Agreement and which previously have been discussed with and agreed to by GSK and, so far as the aforementioned Theravance costs are concerned, for the avoidance of doubt, the maximum amount shall not exceed U.S. $2,940,000. 4.2.3 Decisions with Respect to Products. (a) GSK shall have the sole discretion with respect to Development decisions for Collaboration Products subject to and in accordance with Sections 3.1.5, 3.2.5, and 4.3 . (b) notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that theravance is about to initiate a phase i study in two parts, on td-3327. The initiation of this study will be approved via the Joint Project Committee in accordance with all other Development activities. Theravance shall be responsible for the routine monitoring of this study and will transfer remaining clinical development responsibility for TD-3327 to the Joint Project Committee on completion of the TD-3327 Phase Ia and Phase Ib Studies. (c) gsk shall provide the joint project committee with an update report within thirty days of (i) the initiation (i.e. first person dosed) of any study involving a collaboration product and (ii) the last person dosed/last visit in any study relating to a collaboration product. Gsk will provide the joint project committee with a reasonably detailed "top line results" report within sixty days following the last person dosed/last visit in any study involving a collaboration product. 4.2.4 Development Timelines. It is hereby acknowledged that gsk's strategic objective is to move one or more of the collaboration products into development at the earliest opportunity. GSK will consult with the Joint Project Committee and will share, modify and further develop all applicable Development Plans and timelines in that forum. It is recognised that success can be optimised by pursuing a number of Collaboration Products through various phases of clinical Development up to the point of Technical or Commercial Failure, and/or until the first Collaboration Product for both single agent and combination therapy achieves regulatory agency approval. At a strategic level, GSK is committed to this objective. However, at an operational level it is recognised that internal and external resources will be constrained from time to time, resulting in the need to prioritise individual studies and activities relating to Collaboration Products. GSK will use Diligent Efforts to secure the necessary resource and will keep the Joint Project Committee informed on the progress of individual studies and activities relating to Collaboration Products as part of any changes to Development Plans and timelines. 18





  the current objective of the collaboration is to achieve marketing authorization approval in the us and other major markets for a collaboration product from one of the eight pooled compounds which can be used as a single agent and/or in combination with other therapeutically active components (including but not limited to a long acting inhaled corticosteroid) for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of one or more respiratory diseases by end 2009 for the single agent and 2010 for the first combination product and development plans and timelines will be developed and/or refined in an effort to achieve this objective. 4.3 Replacement Compounds. If within two years after the effective date the development of collaboration products containing any two of the pooled compounds contributed by a party is discontinued due to technical failure it will be the option of the party who contributed the discontinued compounds to discover and offer up to the collaboration two replacement compounds as replacements for the discontinued compounds within twelve months following the discontinuation of the second failed compound. For the avoidance of doubt, any such new compound that satisfies the criteria will automatically be accepted as a pooled compound in place of the relevant party's discontinued compound, subject to joint steering committee approval pursuant to section 3.1.3(f). Nothing in the foregoing shall preclude either Party from having the option of offering up a Replacement Compound for a Pooled Compound at any time during the period referred to in Section 14.5 (subject to the Criteria being met and Joint Steering Committee approval pursuant to Section 3.1.3(f)). 4.4 transfer of data. As soon as practicable but in no event more than thirty (30) days after the Effective Date, the Parties shall determine what data and materials relating to TD-3327 and AMI-15471 are necessary for GSK's Development obligations pursuant to this Article 4, including any technology transfer required for API Compound manufacturing activities contemplated by Article 9, and establish a process for transferring copies of such data and material to GSK (including, to the extent available, in appropriate electronic format) or provide means of access thereto reasonably acceptable to GSK. 4.5 LABA Activity Inside and Outside of the Collaboration. 4.5.1 The intent of the Parties in respect of the Pooled Compounds is that such Pooled Compounds remain exclusive to this Collaboration and, subject to Sections 4.5.2 — 4.5.4 and Article 14 below, no activity in respect of such Pooled Compounds shall be permitted outside of this Agreement. 4.5.2 Subject to Article 14 and to Section 4.5.4, if prior to First Commercial Sale of a GSK Initially Pooled Compound or a GSK Replacement Compound, Development of such compound is discontinued under this Agreement ("GSK Discontinued Compound"), all rights in respect of such GSK Discontinued Compound shall revert in full to GSK and such GSK Discontinued Compound shall automatically fall outside of this Agreement except that (i) GSK shall thereafter be prohibited from carrying out any further clinical Development work or clinical activity in respect of such GSK Discontinued Compound inside the Field for at least four (4) years after the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, GSK shall pay to Theravance a royalty on Net Sales of any such GSK Discontinued Compound in accordance with Section 14.9. 4.5.3 subject to article 14 and section 4.5.4, if prior to first commercial sale of a theravance compound, development of such compound is discontinued under this agreement ("theravance discontinued compound"), all rights in respect of such theravance discontinued compound shall revert in full to theravance and such theravance discontinued compound shall   19





  automatically fall outside of this agreement except that (i) theravance thereafter shall be prohibited from carrying out any further clinical development work or clinical activity in respect of such theravance discontinued compound inside the field until after the termination of this agreement, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, theravance shall pay to gsk a royalty on net sales of any such theravance discontinued compound in accordance with section 14.9. 4.5.4 Notwithstanding Sections 4.5.2 and 4.5.3, for so long as there is one Collaboration Product being Developed under this Agreement, neither Party shall carry out clinical Development inside the Field with any Long Acting B2 Adrenoceptor Agonist that is not a Pooled Compound under this Agreement; Provided, however, that this restriction shall not apply to any compound or product (including new product line extensions and/or re-formulation work) where the original compound or product is, as of the date of signature of this agreement, already commercialized.

In further consideration of the covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties shall also pay to each other the payments set forth below for each such development milestone referred to therein (each, a "development milestone"); Provided always that each such payment shall be made only one time for each collaboration product regardless of how many times such development milestones are achieved for such collaboration product, and no payment shall be owed for a development milestone which is not reached (except that, upon achievement of a development milestone for a particular collaboration product, any previous development milestone for that collaboration product for which payment was not made shall be deemed achieved and payment therefore shall be made). provided further that, in the event that more than one Development Milestone is achieved with respect to the same Collaboration Product at one time, then all applicable payments under Section 6.2 shall be made. For example, if TD-3327 as a single-agent Collaboration Product and a LABA/ICS Combination Product that contains TD- 3327 are approved in the same Marketing Authorization Approval, then in addition to the relevant milestone for the single-agent TD-3327 Collaboration Product, the relevant milestone for the LABA/ICS Combination Product shall be paid simultaneously. In the event of termination of development of a particular Collaboration Product and an alternative Collaboration Product replaces such Terminated Collaboration Product then milestone payments for such replacement compound shall not be paid in respect of milestones already achieved by the Terminated Collaboration Product. For example if development of td-3327 is terminated and td-3327 is replaced by a another collaboration product which contains a theravance compound milestone payments for such replacement compound will only commence for milestones achieved that have not already been achieved by td-3327. 6.2.2 GSK to Theravance. GSK shall make the following milestone payments to Theravance upon the achievement of the indicated Development Milestone for the first Collaboration Product in which the Long-Acting β2 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a Theravance Compound, and for the first LABA/ICS Combination Product in which the Long-Acting β2 Adrenoceptor Agonist is a Theravance Compound:            Milestone

The Parties intend that if the collaboration is successful in launching at least two Collaboration Products that contain a GSK Compound, GSK be paid the applicable milestones through launch for two products. 6.2.4 notification and payment. In the event a Party achieves a Development Milestone, such Party shall promptly, but in no event more than ten (10) days after the achievement of each such Development Milestone, notify the other Party in writing of the achievement of same. For all Development Milestones achieved, each Party shall promptly, but in no event more than thirty (30) days after notification of the achievement of each such Development Milestone, remit payment to the other Party for such Development Milestone. 6.3 Payment of Royalties on Net Sales. 6.3.1 Royalty on Single-Agent Collaboration Products and LABA/ICS Combination Products. Within twenty (20) days after the end of each calendar quarter , gsk shall pay theravance royalty payments based on net sales in such calendar quarter during the term as follows:        on total annual worldwide net sales up to and including u.s. $3 Billion:

  15   %                   On total Annual Worldwide Net Sales greater than U.S. $3 Billion:

  5   %     it being understood that Net Sales of a single agent Collaboration Product will be combined with Net Sales of a LABA/ICS Combination Product for purposes of the foregoing royalty calculation. The quarterly royalty payments made under this Section 6.3.1 may be based on estimated Net Sales. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, GSK shall calculate the actual amount of Net Sales for the previous Calendar Quarter and either credit or debit the difference between such actual and projected amount on the succeeding Calendar Quarter's royalty payment to Theravance. As soon as practical following the end of each calendar month, but in no event later than the 10 business day of the following month, gsk will provide theravance with an estimate of net sales for such calendar month. 24

th





  The royalties payable under this Section 6.3 shall be paid on a Country-by-Country basis from the date of first commercial sale of each Collaboration Product in a particular Country for the Term of the Collaboration. 6.3.2 Royalty Adjustment. The 15% royalty payable on the first U.S. $3 billion of total annual worldwide net sales under this section 6.3 shall be reduced to 12% if all of the following occur: (i) all theravance compounds are discontinued by the collaboration for technical failure; (ii) Theravance only contributes one Theravance New Compound to the collaboration within 18 months following the Effective Date; And (iii) the collaboration product upon which the royalty is payable contains a laba that is one of the gsk initially pooled compounds. The 15% royalty payable on the first U.S. $3 billion of total annual worldwide net sales under this section 6.3 shall be reduced to 10% if all of the following occur: (i) all theravance compounds are discontinued by the collaboration for technical failure. (ii) Theravance fails to contribute any Theravance New Compound to the collaboration within 18 months following the Effective Date; and (iii) the Collaboration Product upon which the royalty is payable contains a LABA that is one of the GSK Initially Pooled Compounds. Nothing in the foregoing shall affect other royalties owed under this Agreement. 6.3.3 royalties on other collaboration products launched after the laba/ics combination product. For any Other Collaboration Product launched after the LABA/ICS Combination Product, GSK shall within twenty (20) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, pay Theravance royalty payments based on Net Sales in such Calendar Quarter during the Term as follows:

Annual Net Sales



Percentage Royalty

                  Up to U.S.$750 Million

  6.5   %                   Additional Net Sales up to U.S.$1.25 Billion

  8.0   %                   Additional Net Sales up to U.S.$2.25 Billion

  9.0   %                   Net Sales exceeding U.S.$2.25 Billion

  10.0   %     For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties agree that the royalty set forth in this Section 6.3.3 shall only be effective if GSK has launched and is selling a LABA/ICS Combination Product that is subject to the royalties under Section 6.3.1. If GSK is not selling a LABA/ICS Combination Product, then the royalty set forth in Section 6.3.1 shall apply to the first Other Combination Product launched by GSK, provided such Other Combination Product does not contain a product in-licensed by GSK; if such Other Combination Product contains a product in-licensed by GSK, then the royalty payable to Theravance will be reduced by 50% of any running royalties paid to a Third Party, provided that in no case will the royalty payable to Theravance be less than set forth in this Section 6.3.3. 25





  6.4 Royalty Responsibilities; Net sales reports. 6.4.1 Payments to Third Parties. (a) If, as a result of a settlement approved by both Parties or as a result of a final non-appealable judgment, GSK is required to pay any amounts to a Third Party directly because using or selling a Theravance Compound is found to infringe the rights of such Third Party, GSK shall deduct fifty percent (50%) of any such amount paid to such Third Party from the royalties otherwise due Theravance for the Collaboration Product containing such Theravance Compound, provided in no event shall such reduction reduce the royalties otherwise payable to Theravance during any Calendar Year by more than fifty percent (50%); provided, further, that any excess deduction shall be carried over into subsequent years of this Agreement until the full deduction is taken. (b) GSK shall pay any amounts owed to a Third Party as a result of the use of GSK Patents or GSK Know-How with respect to sales of Collaboration Products and shall not deduct any of such amounts from the royalties due Theravance. The foregoing is subject to Section 6.3.3. 6.4.2 net sales report. Within thirty (30) days after the end of each Calendar Quarter, GSK shall submit to Theravance a written report setting forth Net Sales in the Territory on a Country-by-Country and Collaboration Product-by-Collaboration Product basis during such Calendar Quarter, total royalty payments due Theravance, relevant market share data and any payments made to any Third Party pursuant to Section 6.4.1(a) (each a "Net Sales Report"). 6.5 GAAP. All financial terms and standards defined or used in this agreement for sales or activities occurring in the united states shall be governed by and determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied. Except as otherwise set forth herein, all financial terms and standards defined or used in this Agreement for sales or activities occurring outside the United States shall be governed by and determined in accordance with United Kingdom generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied. 6.6 Currencies. Monetary conversion from the currency of a foreign country in which collaboration product is sold into us dollars shall be calculated in accordance with either (a) the methodology referred to in gsk's then current corporate finance reporting policy or (b) as otherwise may be mutually agreed by the parties. The following summarizes GSK's current methodology applied in accordance with its current Corporate Finance Reporting System: the cumulative year-to-date Average Rates are calculated by determining the average of (i) the preceding 31st December Spot Rate plus (ii) the Closing Spot Rates of the relevant months to date using the exact figures provided by the Reuters 2000 download. (by way of example, the average rate for the five months from january, 2002 to may, 2002 would be computed by taking the sum of the spot rates for the preceding 31st december, 2001, plus the month-end spot rates for the five months to may, 2002, divided by six). 6.7 Manner of Payments. All sums due to either party under this section 6 shall be payable in united states dollars by bank wire transfer in immediately available funds to such bank account(s) as each of gsk and theravance shall designate. GSK shall notify Theravance as to the date and amount of any such wire transfer to Theravance at least five (5) Business Days prior to such transfer. Theravance shall notify gsk as to the date and amount of any such wire transfer to gsk at least five (5) business days prior to such transfer. 26





  6.8 Interest on Late Payments. If either Theravance or GSK shall fail to make a timely payment pursuant to this Article 6, any such payment that is not paid on or before the date such payment is due under this Agreement shall bear interest, to the extent permitted by applicable law, at the average one-month London Inter-Bank Offering Rate (LIBOR) for the United States Dollar as reported from time to time in The Wall Street Journal, effective for the first date on which payment was delinquent and calculated on the number of days such payment is overdue or, if such rate is not regularly published, as published in such source as the Joint Steering Committee agrees. 6.9 Tax Withholding. 6.9.1 Any taxes, levies or other duties ("Taxes") paid or required to be withheld under the appropriate local tax laws by one of the Parties ("Withholding Party") on account of monies payable to the other Party under this Agreement shall, subject to Sections 6.9.2 and 6.9.3, be deducted from the amount of monies otherwise payable to the other Party under this Agreement. The Withholding Party shall secure and send to the other Party within a reasonable period of time proof of any such Taxes paid or required to be withheld by Withholding Party for the benefit of the other Party. 6.9.2 if gsk or any gsk affiliate is or becomes liable to withhold any taxes from payments made to theravance under sections 6.1 and 6.2 of this agreement, then gsk shall pay to theravance an amount equal to the amount gsk or the applicable gsk affiliate owes to the relevant tax authority provided always that if theravance is able to obtain credit for any taxes withheld ("creditable taxes") against any liability to tax either in the year in which the receipt is taxable or any preceding years, theravance shall reimburse to gsk an amount equivalent to the creditable taxes. Theravance shall provide gsk with such reasonable evidence as gsk may reasonably request to determine whether the taxes are creditable against taxes payable by theravance. 6.9.3 If GSK or any GSK Affiliate is or becomes liable to withhold any taxes from payments made to Theravance under Section 6.3, then such taxes may be withheld by GSK or the applicable GSK Affiliate up to a limit of five percent (5%) of the relevant payment. GSK shall pay to Theravance an amount equal to the amount GSK owes to the relevant tax authority in excess of such five percent (5%) provided always that if Theravance is able to obtain credit for any taxes withheld ("Creditable Taxes") against any liability to tax either in the year in which the receipt is taxable or any preceding years, Theravance shall reimburse to GSK an amount equivalent to the Creditable Taxes. Theravance shall provide GSK with such reasonable evidence as GSK may reasonably request to determine whether the taxes are creditable against taxes payable by Theravance. 6.10 Financial Records; Audits. GSK shall keep, and shall cause its Affiliates and sublicensees to keep, such accurate and complete records of Net Sales as are necessary to determine the amounts due to Theravance under this Agreement and such records shall be retained by GSK or any of its Affiliates or sublicensees (in such capacity, the "Recording Party") for at least the three preceding Calendar Years to which the Net Sales relate. During normal business hours and with reasonable advance notice to the Recording Party, such records shall be made available for inspection, review and audit, at the request and expense of Theravance, by an independent certified public accountant, or the local equivalent, appointed by Theravance and reasonably acceptable to the Recording Party for the sole purpose of verifying the accuracy of the Recording Party's accounting reports and payments made or to be made pursuant to this   27





  Agreement; provided, however that such audits may not be performed by Theravance more than once per Calendar Year. Such accountants shall be instructed not to reveal to theravance the details of its review, except for (i) such information as is required to be disclosed under this agreement and (ii) such information presented in a summary fashion as is necessary to report the accountants' conclusions to theravance, and all such information shall be deemed confidential information of the recording party; provided, however, that in any event such information may be presented to Theravance in a summary fashion as is necessary to report the accountants' conclusions. All costs and expenses incurred in connection with performing any such audit shall be paid by Theravance unless the audit discloses at least a five percent (5%) shortfall, in which case the Recording Party will bear the full cost of the audit for such Calendar Year. Theravance will be entitled to recover any shortfall in payments due to it as determined by such audit, plus interest thereon calculated in accordance with Section 6.8, or alternatively shall have the right to offset and deduct any such shortfall in payments due to it against payments Theravance is otherwise required to make to the Reporting Party under this Agreement. The documents from which were calculated the sums due under this Article 6 shall be retained by the relevant Party during the Term. ARTICLE 7 PROMOTIONAL MATERIALS AND SAMPLES   7.1 Promotional Materials. 7.1.1 Review of Core Promotional Materials. Subject to applicable Law, in accordance with the direction of the Joint Project Committee, the Parties will jointly, through consultation and with the assistance of each other, review the core Promotional Materials.

  12.3 Procedure for Indemnification. 12.3.1 Notice. Each party will notify promptly the other in writing if it becomes aware of a claim (actual or potential) by any third party (a "third party claim") for which indemnification may be sought by that party and will give such information with respect thereto as the other party shall reasonably request. If any proceeding (including any governmental investigation) is instituted involving any Party for which such Party may seek an indemnity under Section 12.1 or 12.2, as the case may be (the "Indemnified Party"), the Indemnified Party shall not make any admission or statement concerning such Third Party Claim, but shall promptly notify the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") orally and in writing and the Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall meet to discuss how to respond to any Third Party Claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. The Indemnifying Party shall not be obligated to indemnify the Indemnified Party to the extent any admission or statement made by the Indemnified Party or any failure by such Party to notify the Indemnifying Party of the claim materially prejudices the defense of such claim. 12.3.2 defense of claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to defend or, if local procedural rules or laws do not permit the same, elects to control the defense of a Third Party Claim, it shall be entitled to do so provided it gives notice to the Indemnified Party of its intention to do so within forty-five (45) days after the receipt of the written notice from the Indemnified Party of the potentially indemnifiable Third Party Claim (the "Litigation Condition"). The indemnifying party expressly agrees the indemnifying party shall be responsible for satisfying and discharging any award made to or settlement reached with the third party pursuant to the terms of this agreement without prejudice to any provision in this agreement or right at law which will allow the indemnifying party subsequently to recover any amount from the indemnified party to the extent the liability under such settlement or award was attributable to the indemnified party. Subject to compliance with the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party shall retain counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party (such acceptance not to be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed) to represent the Indemnified Party and shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such proceeding, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, but the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall not settle any claim for which it is seeking indemnification without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed. The Indemnified Party shall, if requested by the Indemnifying Party, cooperate in all reasonable respects in the defense of such claim that is being managed and/or controlled by the Indemnifying Party. The indemnifying party shall not, without the written consent of the indemnified party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, refused, conditioned or delayed), effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in which the indemnified party is, or based on the same set of facts could have been, a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by the indemnified party, unless such settlement includes an unconditional release of the indemnified party from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such proceeding. If the litigation condition is not met, then neither party shall have the right to control the defense of such third party claim and the parties shall cooperate in and be consulted on the material aspects of such defense at each party's own expense. provided that if the Indemnifying Party does not satisfy the Litigation Condition, the Indemnifying Party may at any subsequent time during the pendency of the relevant Third Party Claim irrevocably elect, if permitted by local procedural rules or laws, to defend and/or to control the defense of the relevant Third Party Claim so long as the Indemnifying Party also agrees to pay the reasonable fees and costs incurred by the Indemnified Party in relation to the defense of such Third Party Claim from   36





  the inception of the Third Party Claim until the date the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense or control thereof. 12.4 Assumption of Defense. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein an indemnified party shall be entitled to assume the defense of any third party claim with respect to the indemnified party upon written notice to the indemnifying party pursuant to this section 12.4 in which case the indemnifying party shall be relieved of liability under section 12.1 or 12.2 as applicable solely for such third party claim and related losses. 12.5 Insurance. During the Term of this Agreement and for a period of one (1) year after the termination or expiration of this Agreement, GSK shall obtain and/or maintain at its sole cost and expense, product liability insurance (including any self-insured arrangements) in amounts which are reasonable and customary in the U.S. pharmaceutical industry for companies of comparable size and activities. Such product liability insurance or self-insured arrangements shall insure against all liability, including without limitation personal injury, physical injury, or property damage arising out of the manufacture, sale, distribution, or marketing of the collaboration products. GSK shall provide written proof of the existence of such insurance to Theravance upon request.

(a) For Patents covering Joint Inventions, the Parties shall agree, without prejudice to ownership, which Party shall have the right to prepare and file a priority patent application, and prosecute such application(s) and maintain any patents derived therefrom, with the Parties equally sharing the reasonable out-of-pocket costs for the preparation, filing, prosecution and maintenance of such priority patent application. The Parties will reasonably cooperate to obtain any export licenses that might be required for such activities. Should the agreed upon Party elect not to prepare and/or file any such priority patent application, it shall (i) provide the other Party with written notice as soon as reasonably possible after making such election but in any event no later than sixty (60) days before the other Party would be faced with a possible loss of rights, (ii) give the other Party the right, at the other Party's discretion and sole expense, to prepare and file the priority application(s), and (iii) offer reasonable assistance in connection with such preparation and filing at no cost to the other Party except for reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the agreed upon Party in rendering such assistance. The other Party, at its discretion and cost, shall prosecute such application(s) and maintain sole ownership of any patents derived therefrom. (b) Within nine (9) months after the filing date of a priority application directed to an Invention, the Party filing the priority application shall request that the other Party identify those non-priority, non-PCT ("foreign") Countries in which the other Party desires that the Party filing the priority application file corresponding patent applications. Within thirty (30) days after receipt by the other Party of such request from the Party filing the priority application, the other Party shall provide to the Party filing the priority application a written list of such foreign countries in which the other Party wishes to effect corresponding foreign patent applications filings. The parties will then attempt to agree on the particular countries in which such applications will be filed provided that in the event agreement is not reached the application will be filed in the disputed as well as the non-disputed countries (all such filings referred to hereinafter as "designated foreign filings"). Thereafter, within twelve (12) months after the filing date of the priority application, the Party filing the priority application shall effect all such Designated Foreign Filings. It is presumed unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties that a corresponding pct application will be filed designating all pct member countries. As to each Designated Foreign Filing and PCT application, GSK shall bear the costs for the filing and prosecutions of such Designated Foreign Filing and PCT application (including entering national phase in all agreed countries). Should the Party filing the priority application not agree to file or cause to be filed a Designated Foreign Filing, the other Party will have the right to effect such Designated Foreign Filing in its name. 38





  (c) Should the filing Party pursuant to Section 13.1.2(a) or 13.1.2(b) no longer wish to prosecute and/or maintain any patent application or patent resulting from such application, the filing Party shall (i) provide the non-filing Party with written notice of its wish no later than sixty (60) days before the patent or patent applications would otherwise become abandoned, (ii) give the non-filing Party the right, at the non-filing Party's election and sole expense, to prosecute and/or maintain such patent or patent application, and (iii) offer reasonable assistance to the non- filing Party in connection with such prosecution and/or maintenance at no cost to the non-filing Party except for reimbursement of the filing Party's reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the filing Party in rendering such assistance.

  schedule 1.19   criteria for theravance new compounds and replacement compounds   1. Single optical isomer, which is patentable. 2. Potency in vitro and in vivo compatible with potential to develop in a DPI device. 3. Intrinsic agonist activity not less than that of salmeterol. 4. Selectivity at β adrenoceptors, relative to β and β  adrenoceptors, similar or superior to that of formoterol, assessed in assays determining equi- potent molar ratios relative to that of isoprenaline (isoproterenol). 5. Selectivity at non-β adrenoceptors >100. 6. No significant inhibition of the hERG potassium channel at a concentration at least 30 fold greater than the anticipated therapeutic maximum concentration in plasma. 7. Duration of agonist activity in vivo to be clearly longer than that of salmeterol. This would be at least 72 hours in the Theravance model.
