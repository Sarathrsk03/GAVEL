You are expected to observe this rule very strictly since failure to do so will entitle the company to stop payment in respect of each day you fail to notify the company. 9.2 if your absence due to sickness or injury is for less than seven (7) days on your return to work you are required to immediately complete a self-certification form available from the company. If your absence continues for more than seven (7) consecutive days (whether or not working days) you must provide the company with a doctor's certificate from the seventh consecutive day of sickness or injury. This doctor's certificate must be provided to the company promptly following the seventh consecutive day of absence.

Such payment shall be inclusive of any statutory sick pay due in accordance with applicable legislation in force at the time of absence. The Company may, in its sole and absolute discretion, extend the period of allowance in an individual case if the circumstances so justify. Thereafter, the Company shall pay statutory sick pay or equivalent benefit to which you may be entitled subject to your compliance with the appropriate rules. 9.4 whether absent from work or not, you may be, but only on reasonable grounds, required to undergo a medical examination by a company doctor and your consent will be sought for a report to be sent to the company. 9.5 the payment of sick pay in accordance with this paragraph 9 is without prejudice to the company's right to terminate this agreement prior to the expiry of your right to payments. 9.6 In the event you are incapable of performing your duties by reason of injuries sustained wholly or partly as a result of a third party's actions all payments made to you by the Company as salary or sick pay shall to the extent that compensation is recoverable from that third party constitute loans to you and shall be due and owing when and to the extent that you recover compensation for loss of earnings from the third party. 10 garden leave
