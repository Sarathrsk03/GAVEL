Dear Terry:

In response to MICOA Holdings's request to develop a complete insurance distribution system for Nevada, including physicians professional liability and personal and commercial insurance by July 1999, Stratton, Cheeseman & Walsh, Inc. (SC&W) has spent and will continue to spend a substantial amount of time and money. In recognition that these expenditures will directly benefit micoa sc&w and micoa agree to the following:

-    during the first two years of developing the nevada distribution system a      portion of the start up costs will be shared. Subject to compliance with a      detailed budget developed by SC&W and MICOA, these reimbursable costs shall      include:

     -    Salaries and benefits for SCW Holdings-Nevada, Inc. employees and agents. -    20% of your total personal benefits and salary, and 100% of your           personal travel expenses incurred with respect to the Nevada office,           which respective percentages are intended to recognize your personal           support of MICOA's Nevada initiative. -    legal expenses directly attributable to the nevada initiative. -    Nevada office set up. -    Consultant's expenses paid by SC&W in direct support of the           initiative. -    The above costs are to be designated and itemized in the preapproved           budget and reimbursed by MICOA at 100% for the first full year of           development and 50% for the second year. It is agreed that the first           year began effective October 1, 1997. -    all other costs attributable to the normal operation of the nevada      insurance agency site are the sole responsibility of sc&w. -    After the first two years (i.e. after October 1, 1999) all expenses will      be borne by SC&W and those amounts paid to SC&W during the first two years      shall be repaid. Repayment shall be through reduction of commissions due      SC&W by 0.5% or if

                                      -7-

     SC&Wexceeds $10.0 million in premium revenues by offset in the event any      money is owed the Agency by MICOA. Such reduction or offset shall occur for      so long as necessary to repay amounts reimbursed by micoa during the      two-year period of development; but in no event will repayment be collected      for a period of greater than ten years. Any unpaid amounts at the end of      ten years shall be forgiven by MICOA Holdings. -    Nevada rent expenses will be shared on a 50/50 basis between MICOA and      SC&W. -    In order to allow SC&W to expand the distribution system in Nevada with      select and controlled subagents Holdings, an exclusive agency agreement will be      negotiated which will spell out the terms and conditions of the      relationship. A commission rate of 12% will be paid for both new and      renewal physicians liability business. Other commission rates will be      determined as products become available. This agency agreement should be      finalized by april 30, 1999. -    MICOA may pay future payments advanced pursuant to this letter on a monthly      basis, unless doing so would be impractical, in which case another periodic      form of&bbsp;payment will be arranged. Amounts owed for past time periods will      be paid as follows Holdings: one-third by March 25, 1999; One-third by may 1, 1999; and one-third by June  Holdings1, 1999. All other amounts owed under this Project      Memorandum to be paid by October 1, 1999.
