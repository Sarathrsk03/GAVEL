(a) Current and Expanded Capacity. The parties agree and acknowledge that as of the effective date mediwound's current facility can fill orders from vericel for use in the territory up to [***] of intermediate drug product whether provided in that form or in the form of the equivalent amount of finished product within a calendar year ("maximum capacity"). The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Facility will require either expansion or modification (which may include moving to or adding another location) to meet future capacity requirements for the Product. By no later than [***], MediWound shall fund, at its sole cost, the expansion of its annual manufacturing capacity to be [***] of Intermediate Drug Product (whether provided in that form or in the form of the equivalent amount of Finished Product). The Parties will in good faith review existing market research to mutually agree on peak anticipated volume prior to [***]. After the foregoing expansion, the expanded capacity shall be deemed the "Maximum Capacity" for purposes of this Agreement. As part of the expansion of the Facility, the Parties will discuss any shut down or transfer to another facility made in connection therewith. (b) Shut-Down or Expansion of Facility; Transfer to Another Facility. In the event that mediwound desires to cease or shut down operations at a facility, expand or modify a facility, or transfer the manufacturing of a product to another facility which would reasonably be anticipated to result in inability (permanent or temporary) of mediwound to manufacture, supply or otherwise perform its obligations hereunder, mediwound shall provide prior written notice to vericel within the applicable change notification period of such planned shut-down, cessation, expansion, modification or transfer. During such Change Notification Period, Vericel

7 9012190/26

will have the right to order, and in such case MediWound will manufacture, up to [***] of quantities of Product set forth in the Rolling Forecast with respect to such Change Notification Period which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Notwithstanding the foregoing mediwound shall remain obligated to supply product at the then current facility and will not supply product to vericel from a new facility unless and until mediwound can perform the manufacturing and supply product from such new facility in accordance with the terms of this agreement and any modifications to the regulatory filings for such product are approved by the relevant regulatory authorities. MediWound shall bear all costs incurred in connection with the shut-down, cessation, expansion or modification of the Facility or transfer of the Manufacturing of a Product to a new facility pursuant to this Section 2.6(b), including any costs associated with changes to the regulatory filings. Once such new facility is able to Manufacture in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and all required regulatory changes have been approved, such new facility shall be the Facility for purposes of such Product under this Agreement. 2.7 establishment of second source. (a) Within [***] of the Effective Date, MediWound must provide Vericel with true and accurate copies of all documents consistent with Schedule 2.7. If MediWound does not provide all documents within [***] of the Effective Date, Vericel's obligation under Section 8.1 regarding the time period to provide MediWound with a notice of an extension of the Initial Term shall be extended by the amount of time beyond [***] taken by MediWound to provide the required documents. (b) Within [***] of a request by Vericel to initiate technology transfer or as soon as reasonably practicable upon request by Vericel in connection with a Supply Failure, MediWound shall provide Vericel, at Vericel's cost consistent with Schedule 4.5, with information necessary for Vericel to qualify a second or back-up supplier identified by Vericel for the Manufacture and supply of Product (a "Second Source") and facilitate technology transfer to such Second Source so that Vericel can consistently manufacture intermediate and final product that meets all specifications. MediWound will notify the IIA in accordance with applicable Israeli Laws upon the commencement of Manufacture of Product by such Second Source. MediWound will provide Vericel with access to the manufacturing process and information and any and all original processes, records, and any other information required to manufacture, package and test the Product in accordance with the Specifications. Second Source manufacturers shall be permitted to manufacture Product for Vericel, its Affiliates and Sublicensees as provided in Section 9.1 and the License Agreement; provided that such Second Source manufacturers: [***]. 2.8 Forecasting and Ordering. (a) forecasting. Vericel shall furnish MediWound with a [***] rolling forecast of the quantities of each Product that Vericel intends to order during the succeeding [***] period (each, a "Rolling Forecast") which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity for the Binding Forecast. No later than [***] after the filing of a bla, vericel shall

8 9012190/26

furnish mediwound the first rolling forecast. Subject to this Section 2.8, the [***] of each Rolling Forecast shall constitute a binding order for the quantities of Product specified ("Binding Forecast"). The remaining [***] of each rolling forecast shall be non-binding but shall represent vericel's good faith estimate as of the date of its submission of the rolling forecast of its forecasted requirements of the product during such period. MediWound shall maintain at all times the manufacturing capacity at the relevant Facility to manufacture [***] of the quantities of Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. (b) Purchase Orders. On a calendar quarter basis vericel shall issue at least one purchase order for the number and unit size of each product specified in the binding forecast. Vericel is not limited to one purchase order per calendar quarter. Each Purchase Order shall specify (i) a purchase order number; (ii) the quantity of units of each Product to be Manufactured; and (iii) the requested delivery date of such Product (which in no event shall be earlier than [***] days following the date the applicable Purchase Order was received by MediWound). MediWound shall respond to each Purchase Order within [***] of receipt by: (i) accepting such Purchase Order if it conforms to the requirements of this Agreement or (ii) notifying Vericel if such Purchase Order does not conform to the requirements of this Agreement. If mediwound timely notifies vericel that a purchase order does not conform to the requirements of this agreement, the parties shall confer as soon as reasonably practicable to resolve any issues related to such purported nonconformity. If mediwound fails to respond to a purchase order that is consistent with the binding forecast within [***] after receiving it, vericel will, within [***] thereafter, confirm with mediwound that such purchase order was received by mediwound, and if such purchase order is consistent with the binding forecast and was properly submitted by vericel in accordance with this section 2.8(b), mediwound shall be deemed to have accepted such purchase order ("binding order") as of the date of mediwound's receipt of such purchase order. If a Purchase Order contains quantities of Products in excess of the quantity of such Product forecasted for such quarter (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year) by an amount greater than [***] of the Binding Forecast ("Excess Amount"), MediWound will accept the Purchase Order up to, but not including the Excess Amount which in any event will not exceed the Maximum Capacity. Should vericel place a purchase order to procure a given product in a given calendar quarter which includes an excess amount, mediwound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet vericel's request. If there is a conflict between this Agreement and any Purchase Order, this Agreement shall govern. (c) Minimum Purchase Obligation. In each Calendar Year following Vericel's submission of the first Rolling Forecast, Vericel shall issue Purchase Orders for at least [***] of the quantities of each Product set forth in the current Calendar Year of the Rolling Forecast (as was set forth at the Rolling Forecast submitted immediately prior to the beginning of such Calendar Year). (d) BARDA. As of the Effective Date, MediWound is a party to BARDA Contract HHSO100201500035C and BARDA Contract HHSO100201800023C (collectively, the

9 9012190/26

"BARDA Agreements") with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority ("BARDA"). The Parties agree that until commercial obligations under such BARDA Agreements are transferred to Vericel, MediWound shall remain responsible for the supply and other obligations and shall manage the forecasts and production schedule for such BARDA Agreements. During such period any product ordered by barda from mediwound will not be included in purchase orders binding orders rolling forecasts or the minimum purchase obligation set forth in section 2.8(c); provided that the Product ordered by BARDA from MediWound will be included in the Maximum Capacity and thus the applicable Maximum Capacity for the Binding Orders will be adjusted accordingly. If and when commercial obligations under such barda agreements are transferred to vericel, then vericel shall become responsible for including the applicable purchases by barda in its purchase orders, binding orders and rolling forecasts and such purchases will be included in the maximum capacity and the minimum purchase obligation set forth in section 2.8(c). 2.9 Delivery. (a) shipping. MediWound shall only ship Products that have been Manufactured and released in accordance with the Specifications. Unless agreed in advance by Vericel and MediWound in writing, MediWound shall not ship (or permit such Third Party packager to ship) any Products prior to approval and release by MediWound in accordance with the Quality Agreement and Regulatory Standards. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the Parties, Products shall be delivered to Vericel Ex-Works (Incoterms 2010), at MediWound's facility (the "Delivery Site") at which point, the title and risk of loss shall transfer to Vericel which shall transfer the Products from the Delivery Site in accordance with cGMP as applicable. MediWound shall notify (or cause such Third Party packager to notify) Vericel at least [***] prior to any shipment of Products. (b) delivery amount. MediWound shall deliver Product within [***] of the units set out on the relevant Purchase Order. To the extent that a delivery is in excess of [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel may accept such excess Product provided that if Vericel accepts such excess, Vericel shall be entitled, (i) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product to the extent reasonably required due to the acceptance of such excess, and (ii) to reduce subsequent Purchase Orders and take credits for the amount of excess Product received against the minimum purchase obligation set forth in Section 2.8(c). To the extent that a delivery is less than [***] but at least [***] of the amount set out on the relevant Purchase Order, Vericel shall accept such delivery and shall be entitled, (A) where commercially reasonable for Vericel, to vary the delivery date agreed between Vericel and MediWound in accordance with Section 2.8 for the immediately following shipment(s) of the applicable Product due to the acceptance of such delivery, and (B) to increase subsequent Purchase Orders with the applicable shortage quantities. (c) on time delivery. Mediwound's performance with respect to "on time delivery" will be measured as delivery to vericel [***] before or after the delivery date agreed

10 9012190/26

between vericel and mediwound in accordance with section 2.8; Provided that mediwound shall be deemed to have made a delivery during the "on time delivery" window if the delay in delivery to vericel is due to vericel's failure to comply with its obligations under this agreement (including in connection with vericel's review of the batch records). 2.10 Dating. The remaining shelf-life for each Product for the Territory shall be at least [***] of the FDA approved shelf-life of such Product, as measured from the time of delivery of such Product to Vericel (the "Minimum Shelf Life"). 2.11 safety stock. MediWound shall be entitled to meet its obligation to maintain as safety stock not less than [***] of the Rolling Forecast demand of stock of each of the Key Materials (the "Safety Stock") so long as the Minimum Shelf Life has been satisfied by holding either Product or an equivalent quantity of Materials, or a mixture of the two. The Parties will cooperate to set minimum inventory levels of Key Materials held by Key Materials Suppliers. Vericel shall maintain an inventory of [***] supply of unlabeled or labeled Finished Product in order to supply its commercial requirements in accordance with the Rolling Forecast, which may be stored at Facility at Vericel's option, cost and risk. 2.12 Non-Conforming Product. (a) rejection notice. Unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties in writing, within [***] after receipt of a delivery of Product hereunder, Vericel shall give MediWound written notice of rejection ("Rejection Notice") (i) if the Product does not constitute Conforming Product ("Non-Conforming Product") or (ii) of any shortage in quantity of such delivery of Product. Any such rejection notice provided with respect to any quantity of product shall be deemed to apply to the full batch of such product unless otherwise specified by vericel. Vericel shall be deemed to have accepted such shipment of Product as Conforming Product and any shortage in quantity if it does not provide Rejection Notice within [***] after receipt of delivery describing the reasons for such rejections in reasonable detail, provided, however, that such [***] period shall not apply to any Latent Defects, in which case Vericel shall notify MediWound of any such failure as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event within [***] after the Latent Defect is confirmed by Vericel and prior to expiration of the shelf-life for such Product. (b) disputes. In the event that MediWound disagrees with Vericel's claim that Product fails to constitute Conforming Product, then the Parties shall promptly attempt to resolve such dispute. If the Parties cannot resolve such dispute, a sample of such Product shall be submitted by MediWound and Vericel to a mutually agreeable qualified Third Party laboratory for testing against the applicable Specifications, Regulatory Standards and other standards and controls in the Quality Agreement and the test results obtained by such laboratory shall be final and controlling (absent manifest error). Test results must be furnished to both Parties within [***] of concluding such testing. The fees and expenses of such laboratory testing and any obsolescence due to short dating shall be borne entirely by the Party whose original Product analysis was in error. 11 9012190/26

(c) Remedy. On receipt of Vericel's Rejection Notice pursuant to Section 2.12(a), subject to Section 2.12(b), MediWound shall, [***] (except if such Non-Conforming Product is due to MediWound's gross negligence or willful misconduct):

(i) deliver the appropriate shortage quantities of Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel; (ii) replace the Non-Conforming Product with Conforming Product as promptly as possible, at no additional cost or expense (including, without limitation, freight costs) to Vericel; or

(iii) promptly grant Vericel a credit in an amount equal to the amount paid or payable by Vericel with respect to reasonable out of pocket expenses directly associated with the Non-Conforming Product to the extent applicable (e.g. shipment costs, destruction fees, and restocking fees) and any such shortage or Non-Conforming Product, including, without limitation, but solely in the case of Non-Conforming Product, expenses associated with destruction or return at MediWound's instruction. This subsection (iii) shall additionally apply in the event vericel elects as its option the foregoing (i) or (ii) as applicable and such delivery or replace of product thereunder is not practicable within a reasonable period of time (as reasonably determined by mediwound). 2.13 Shortages. (a) Without limiting any other rights or remedies available to Vericel, in the event of any shortage in the supply of any Materials or Product, or if MediWound is for any other reason unable to supply Product in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, then MediWound will promptly notify Vericel and, in the event such inability is caused by a shortage of any Materials and/or capacity required for the Manufacture of any Product, will take all commercially reasonable steps to (i) procure adequate quantities of Materials from Third Party suppliers reasonably acceptable to Vericel, and (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to fulfill all Binding Orders for Product. (b) Prior to a Second Source commencing supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of (i) any Materials required to Manufacture Product or (ii) Product, MediWound will allocate the available Materials to the Manufacture of Product for sale to Vericel and will allocate the available Product for sale to Vericel, in each case ((i) or (ii)), to the extent any Binding Orders then in place prior to allocating such materials to the Manufacture of any other product (including EscharEx), or for any entity other than Vericel. (c) After a Second Source commences supply of Product, in the event of a shortage of Materials or Product, MediWound will allocate to Vericel its pro rata share of MediWound's supply of the same in a manner no less favorable than those of its equivalently situated customers or MediWound's own similarly situated products. 12 9012190/26

(d) The Parties will cooperate to discuss expansion plans, address capacity and any other product supply issues, including efficient use of resources, manufacturing schedules and shipping schedules. 2.14 supply failures. In the event that MediWound becomes aware of the existence of a situation that may lead to a Supply Failure, then MediWound shall promptly (and in no event later than [***] from the date of such awareness) notify Vericel of the particular circumstances. MediWound and Vericel shall promptly discuss how to resolve such circumstances in an effort to avoid or mitigate such potential Supply Failure. MediWound shall investigate the root cause of the anticipated Supply Failure and prepare and provide to Vericel a Remediation Plan within [***] of MediWound's notice to Vericel. If the Remediation Plan is acceptable to Vericel, and MediWound is able to reasonably assure Vericel of MediWound's ability to Manufacture Product and, thereby, (a) avoid a Supply Failure or (b) supply Product in accordance with the Rolling Forecast within [***], then MediWound shall continue to Manufacture Product for Vericel. In all other cases, Vericel shall be permitted to take such measures as are reasonably determined in good faith by Vericel to ensure the supply of Product to the marketplace including cancelling or revising outstanding Purchase Orders and, at Vericel's option, Vericel's obligations under Section 2.8(a), (b) and (c) shall be deemed terminated.

ARTICLE 4 CHANGES

4.1 Changes. MediWound shall not change the Specifications or Manufacturing process for the Manufacture of Product for supply to Vericel for the Territory hereunder except as expressly permitted pursuant to this Article 4. Each Party shall notify the other Party of any change in the Regulatory Standards applicable to the Manufacturing of Product for the supply to Vericel for the Territory that could reasonably affect the obligations of MediWound under this Agreement. All changes shall include an assessment of the need for regulatory submission and approval by a method to be defined in the Quality Agreement. The applicable notification period for any change or proposed change by a Party to the Manufacturing process or Specifications for a Product or Key Materials, the Facility and other Manufacturing changes (the "Change Notification Period") is set forth on Schedule 4.1. 4.2 changes to facility. Except as expressly permitted pursuant to section 2.6 and this article 4, mediwound shall not perform any change of any part of any facility, change the physical location within the facility for manufacturing any products or change the facility at which the manufacturing of any products takes place, if such change would reasonably be expected to (a) impact the regulatory approval for one or more of the products or any regulatory compliance program. Or (b) result in inability (permanent or temporary) of mediwound to manufacture supply or otherwise perform its obligations per vericel's rolling forecast in accordance with this agreement. For any change in the facility at which the manufacturing of any products takes place, mediwound shall (i) give vericel notice within the applicable change notification period, and (ii) provide vericel a plan for avoiding any interruption in supply that may result from such change. In the event of a "major" change to the facility (as detailed in schedule 4.1) such change will be treated in accordance with section 2.6(b). 4.3 Discretionary Manufacturing Changes. Vericel may propose changes to the specifications or manufacturing process for the supply of product to vericel for the territory that are not regulatory changes (any such change a "discretionary manufacturing change"). If agreed to by MediWound, MediWound or its Suppliers will use commercially reasonable efforts to make such proposed changes, and Vericel will bear [***] of the costs associated with such changes. Mediwound may propose changes to the specifications or manufacturing process for the supply of product for the territory that are not regulatory changes. MediWound shall propose any such Discretionary Manufacturing Change in accordance with the applicable

16 9012190/26

Change Notification Period prior to the proposed implementation. [***]. Vericel shall, within [***] of receipt of mediwound's notice, notify mediwound in writing whether vericel accepts or rejects the proposed change, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed unless consultations with regulatory authorities are required to assess the impact of such proposed change. 4.4 Regulatory Changes. (a) notwithstanding any other provision under this agreement to the contrary if either party receives notice or is otherwise informed of any change to the manufacturing process or specifications for a product or key materials the facility or any change that has an impact of the obligations of vericel or mediwound under this agreement that is required by applicable law or that is otherwise required by any applicable regulatory authority (any such change a "regulatory change") such party shall promptly deliver notice thereof to the other party. Within the applicable Change Notification Period, MediWound shall notify Vericel in writing of MediWound's good faith and reasonable determination as to (i) whether MediWound is technically able to comply with such Regulatory Change, (ii) whether the Regulatory Change would adversely affect MediWound's ability to timely manufacture and supply any Product supplied hereunder and (iii) the costs to implement such Regulatory Change. MediWound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause Key Material Suppliers to provide such notice of any Regulatory Change to MediWound or Vericel. (b) If MediWound determines it is technically unable to comply with the Regulatory Change at the Facility in the timeframe required by the applicable Regulatory Authority, then, in MediWound's discretion, it shall have the right to transfer the Manufacturing of the applicable Product to an alternative facility of MediWound that is qualified and approved for Manufacturing such Product in accordance with this Agreement, if available. In the event MediWound is unable to supply Product as a result of such Regulatory Change, Vericel, in its sole discretion, shall be entitled to source all or any portion of Vericel's requirements of the applicable Product, until MediWound regains the ability to supply Product, from a Third Party, including from the Second Source. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this agreement, if as a result of a regulatory change, mediwound is unable to manufacture and supply a product to vericel, vericel shall be entitled to source such product, until mediwound regains the ability to supply product, from a third party or second source in accordance with this section 4.4(b), in which case mediwound shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide vericel with reasonable technical assistance with regard to transferring the technology relating to the product to such third party, and the parties shall discuss the allocation of such costs related to such transfer, including mediwound's expenses and any incremental costs of supply of such product and materials from such third party consistent with schedule 4.5. (c) if mediwound determines it is technically able to implement a regulatory change required by a regulatory authority in the territory, the costs for such regulatory change shall be borne by vericel consistent with schedule 4.5. 17 9012190/26

4.5 Ongoing Regulatory Assistance. Within [***] following vericel's request, mediwound shall provide technical data and assistance in answering vericel's questions (a) for regulatory filings and for process changes initiated by mediwound at no cost to vericel, (b) for process changes initiated by vericel at the cost of vericel for the applicable number of hours at a full time equivalent rate described in schedule 4.5, (c) for new regulatory registrations, which shall be at vericel's cost, and (d) for periodic regulatory reporting and questions from regulatory authorities, which shall be at the cost of vericel. ARTICLE 5  PRICE AND PAYMENT TERMS

5.1 Supply Price. On a product-by-product basis the price payable in u.s. Dollars by vericel for supply of such product for a given calendar year shall be as set forth on a per unit basis on exhibit a (with respect to each product, the "supply price"), which shall be updated on a calendar year basis in accordance with section 5.2 below. 5.2 Price Mechanics. (a) Beginning on [***] (each, a "Re-Pricing Date"), MediWound may annually increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year in accordance with the terms of this Section 5.2. MediWound may increase the Supply Price for a Calendar Year if the United States Producer Price Index (Chemical Manufacturing) published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (the "PPI") [***] and (b) in the event the PPI [***]. MediWound shall give Vericel at least [***] prior written notice of any such adjustment to the Supply Price. (b) in addition to the foregoing price adjustment mechanism mediwound may propose an adjustment to the supply price to reflect changes that substantially affect mediwound's costs or ability to supply product. MediWound shall provide Vericel with written notice of such changes and its proposed adjustment and provide appropriate documentation demonstrating that the price adjustment is required. Following Vericel's receipt of such notice and documentation, the Parties will engage in good faith discussions to negotiate a mutually agreed upon adjustment to the Supply Price, if any. (c) Unless otherwise agreed by the Parties, the adjusted Supply Price will be the Supply Price for the next applicable Purchase Order placed after Vericel's receipt of notification of the adjusted Supply Price, and shall apply to each Purchase Order placed thereafter until the next adjustment is made (if any) in accordance with the above mechanism. 5.3 cost savings. Either party may propose changes to any manufacturing process in order to obtain efficiencies and cost savings in such process ("cost savings change"). The proposing Party shall submit to the other Party a proposal detailing the Cost Savings Change, the implementation of such Cost Savings Change, and the analysis of the expected efficiencies and cost savings from such Cost Savings Change. If Vericel proposes a Cost Savings Change and (a) MediWound determines it is technically able to implement the Cost Savings Change, (b) the Cost Savings Change would not materially adversely affect the applicable Facility, and (c) Vericel agrees to pay the costs to implement such Costs Saving Change as an Additional Service Fee,

18 9012190/26

MediWound shall agree to implement such proposed change which MediWound shall not unreasonably decline to implement. If MediWound proposes a Cost Savings Change and the Parties agree to its implementation, (i) Vericel shall pay MediWound the agreed amount to implement such change as an Additional Service Fee prior to the implementation of such Cost Savings Change; and (ii) MediWound shall make its reasonable commercial efforts to implement such Cost Savings Change pursuant to a mutually agreed upon schedule. In the event cost savings are actually achieved, then the cost saving will be [***] between the Parties (i.e. [***] of the cost savings shall be added to the new discounted Supply Price). 5.4 payments. Unless specified otherwise, any payment to be made by Vericel under this Agreement shall be made within [***] from date of invoice. It is hereby agreed that the invoice with respect to any shipment will be issued upon the delivery date. The parties' respective rights and responsibilities under sections 5.6.5 and 5.6.6 of the license agreement shall apply as such section pertains to the parties' performance under this agreement, and are hereby incorporated by reference. 5.5 Late Payments. Any payments due under this agreement shall be due on such date as specified in this agreement and, in the event such date is not a business day, then the next succeeding business day. In the event that any payment due under this Agreement is not made when due, the amount due shall accrue interest beginning on the [***] following the date on which such payment was due, calculated at the [***] for the due date, or, if lower, the maximum rate permitted by law, calculated from the due date until paid in full. Each payment made after the due date shall be accompanied by all interest so accrued. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party shall have recourse to any other remedy available at law or in equity with respect to any delinquent payment, subject to the terms of this agreement. 5.6 taxes. Vericel shall be responsible for the payment of any value added or similar tax (but excluding, for avoidance of doubt, any tax on the income of MediWound) on the Products delivered by MediWound to Vericel, to the extent such taxes are itemized and included on a valid invoice and required to be collected from Vericel under applicable Law. In addition, in the event any payments made by Vericel pursuant to this Agreement become subject to withholding taxes under the Laws or regulations of any jurisdiction or Governmental Authority, Vericel shall deduct and withhold the amount of such taxes for the account of MediWound to the extent required by applicable Laws or regulations; such amounts payable to MediWound shall be reduced by the amount of taxes deducted and withheld; and Vericel shall pay the amounts of such taxes to the proper Governmental Authority in a timely manner and transmit to MediWound an official tax certificate or other evidence of such tax obligations together with proof of payment from the relevant Governmental Authority of all amounts deducted and withheld. Any such withholding taxes required under applicable laws or regulations to be paid or withheld shall be an expense of, and borne solely by, mediwound. Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other Party in claiming refunds or exemptions from such deductions or withholdings under any relevant agreement or treaty which is in effect. The Parties shall discuss applicable mechanisms for minimizing such taxes to the extent possible in compliance with applicable Laws. Vericel will provide mediwound with reasonable assistance to enable mediwound to recover such taxes as permitted by applicable laws or regulations. 19 9012190/26

Following the initial term vericel may without penalty or prejudice to any other rights or remedies vericel may have in its sole discretion terminate or reduce the scope of any individual activities contemplated by this agreement or any additional service or with respect to any product or terminate this agreement as a whole with or without cause upon [***] prior written notice of such termination or reduction (which such written notice may be provided during the initial term). 8.5 termination by mediwound. Following the Initial Term, MediWound may terminate this Agreement by notice in writing to Vericel upon on at least [***] advanced written notice (or such longer period of time as reasonably necessary to avoid a supply disruption) if MediWound determines to cease Manufacturing the applicable Product for the Territory, but in such case MediWound will reasonably cooperate with Vericel to enable Vericel to establish its own source for the Product (including, to the extent requested by Vericel and within

24 9012190/26

MediWound's ability to do so, by transferring MediWound's applicable Third Party manufacturing relationships to Vericel). 8.6 Effects of Termination. Any expiration or termination of this Agreement shall not affect any claims that have accrued or outstanding obligations or payments due hereunder prior to such termination or expiration, nor shall it prejudice any other remedies that the Parties may have under this Agreement. In addition, upon the expiration or earlier termination of this Agreement:

(a) if Vericel terminates the Agreement for breach or MediWound terminates in accordance with Section 8.5, Vericel shall have the option of [***]

(b) Vericel shall pay to MediWound: (i) all amounts outstanding and remaining to be paid for Product supplied prior to such expiration or termination or under any other obligation under the Agreement; (ii) all amounts for Product in the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders prior to the expiration or termination, provided that MediWound delivers such Product in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) all amounts representing the purchase by MediWound of Materials in reliance upon the Binding Forecasts and Binding Orders (if MediWound is unable to cancel (without incurring any costs) or otherwise use such Materials); And (iv) all amounts representing remaining inventory of product and all product work in process undertaken in accordance with the binding forecasts or binding orders or undertaken otherwise in accordance with the terms of this agreement. (c) following expiration of the royalty term (as defined in the license agreement) for any licensed product in a given country, the license granted to vericel under section 9.1 of this agreement with respect to such licensed product in such country shall automatically become fully paid-up, perpetual, irrevocable and royalty-free. 8.7 Survival. Upon expiration or termination of this Agreement for any reason, the following terms of this Agreement shall survive: Article 1, Sections 3.2, 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6, Article 7, Article 8, Sections 9.1 and 9.2 (except in the event of termination of the License Agreement under Section 9.2, 9.3 or 9.4 thereof), Section 9.3, Article 10, and Article 11. ARTICLE 9 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

9.1 Manufacturing License Grant. Subject to the terms herein, MediWound hereby grants to Vericel a non-exclusive, sublicensable (subject to Section 4.2 of the License Agreement) license under the MediWound Technology and MediWound's interest in the Joint Technology, to Manufacture and have Manufactured Licensed Products in the Territory for use in the Field in the Territory. 9.2 Trademarks License Grant. MediWound hereby grants to Vericel an exclusive (even as to MediWound), sublicensable, royalty- free, fully paid-up, license in the Territory to use the Licensed Trademarks (as defined in the License Agreement) and a non- exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free, fully paid-up, license to use the MediWound name and trademark, in

25 9012190/26

each case, in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in or for the Territory. All uses of the licensed trademarks by vericel (and its affiliates sublicensees and distributors) in connection with the manufacture of licensed products in or for the territory shall be in accordance with regulatory approvals and all applicable laws and mediwound's quality control guidelines for the licensed trademarks as may be amended from time to time. Vericel (and its Affiliates) shall only use the Licensed Trademarks licensed hereunder in connection with the Manufacture of Licensed Products in the Territory. Vericel shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates, Sublicensee and Distributors not to) use such Licensed Trademarks to identify, or in connection with the marketing of, any other products. 9.1 Ownership. Ownership of all inventions and discoveries made by the parties in the course of manufacturing and supply of the product hereunder (including manufacture and supply of product) shall be determined in accordance with the terms of the license agreement. ARTICLE 10  FORCE MAJEURE

10.1 Excusing Performance. Neither Party shall be liable for the failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement to the extent such failure is due to events beyond the reasonable control of the non-performing Party, including fires, floods, earthquakes, hurricanes, embargoes, shortages, epidemics, quarantines, war, acts of war (whether war be declared or not), terrorist acts, insurrections, riots, civil commotion, strikes, lockouts or other labor disturbances involving the workforce of any Third Party, or acts of God (a "Force Majeure Event"). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the occurrence of a force majeure event will not excuse or prevent a failure of mediwound to deliver product from being deemed a "supply failure" or otherwise limit vericel's rights, to the extent applicable, under section 2.13. 10.2 notice of force majeure event. A Party claiming a right to be excused from performance under Section 10.1 shall immediately notify the other Party in writing of the extent of its inability to perform, which notice shall specify the Force Majeure Event and the estimated likely period of time during which its performance will be affected. 10.3 Resumption; Termination. A non-performing Party as a result of a Force Majeure Event shall use reasonable best efforts, at its own expense, to eliminate the Force Majeure Event and to mitigate the effect of such cause and resume performance under this Agreement, in each case, as soon as practicable and for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues. Further, consistent with diligent risk management practices, mediwound will keep current a risk management program. If MediWound is affected by any Force Majeure Event, MediWound agrees to perform its obligations under this Section 10.3 to mitigate the effect thereof and resume performance under this Agreement in the same manner as MediWound would use to resolve any similar disruptions affecting its own products (including EscharEx). MediWound shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the impact of the Force Majeure Event shall not be relatively greater for Vericel than it is for MediWound with respect to MediWound's products (including EscharEx). 26 9012190/26
