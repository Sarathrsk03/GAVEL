Vendor shall work with AT&T in facilitating the Subcontractor's cooperation for an expeditious and thorough audit or inspection. (ii) If Vendor's contract with its applicable Subcontractor precludes AT&T from directly conducting an audit or inspection, Vendor shall use reasonable best efforts to enable AT&T to perform an audit of the Subcontractor with Vendor coordinating the audit process Holdings. Failing those efforts, Vendor shall, upon AT&T's request and at AT&T's expense, conduct the audit or inspection on behalf of AT&T, subject to terms agreed to by Vendor and AT&T for the Subcontractor audit, such as areas to be audited, applicable fees, and the timeframe for reporting audit results to AT&T.

furnished. Neither response nor non-response by AT&Tconcerningthereceiptornon-receipt of any FOSS Disclosure or any reference to FOSS in the Agreement shall be deemed as acceptance, approval or acquiescence by AT&T that Vendor's use of the FOSS complies with the legal requirements of applicable FOSS license(s), or is suitable for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder. After receiving any FOSS Disclosure, AT&T may, upon written notice to Vendor, ask Vendor to use alternate FOSS Holdings (or other alternate software), if reasonably warranted to avert a risk that the rights of AT&T or its third-party Contractors in any proprietary software may be compromised. In that event if vendor cannot or will not use such alternate foss then at&t may immediately terminate the relevant purchase or funding commitments under this agreement without further cost expense or liability to at&t. (c) Vendor represents and warrants to AT&T: (i) that Vendor has satisfied all its obligations to any third parties with respect to all FOSS and the applicable FOSS licenses (including, for example, any obligation to make publicly available the FOSS source code for modifications to such FOSS); (ii) that the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, is suitable for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder; (iii) that use of the foss in such form for such intent and purposes in no manner creates any added obligation on the part of at&t (including, for example, the payment of any additional monies), or diminishes, conditions or eliminates any of the rights, title, or interest that vendor grants at&t in or to any deliverables or that vendor may otherwise provide at&t under this agreement. and (iv) that use of the FOSS in such form for such intent and purposes Holdings, including, but not limited to, AT&T's use or combination of the FOSS, in the form provided to AT&T, with any proprietary software of AT&T or AT&T's third-party Contractors, does not subject AT&T to any obligation of disclosure or distribution to any third party or to the public of any such proprietary software, or otherwise make such proprietary software subject to the terms of any FOSS license or impair AT&T's or its third-party Contractors' rights, title, or interest in or to such proprietary software. (d) in the event that at&t notifies vendor or vendor becomes aware of vendor's noncompliance with any foss license term then in either case vendor shall use all reasonable efforts promptly to cure such noncompliance so as to eliminate risks of public disclosure of proprietary software and prevent disruption of any at&t business activity. Vendor shall promptly notify at&t of all actions taken by vendor to cure such noncompliance Holdings. Should AT&T receive notice from any third party alleging acts or omissions which, notwithstanding AT&T's use of the FOSS for the intent and purposes furnished hereunder, constitute noncompliance with any FOSS license term, then promptly upon AT&T's notice to Vendor of such allegation, Vendor shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless AT&T against such allegation in accordance with Vendor's obligations to do so as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, in a manner that preserves any proprietary software of AT&T or its third-party Contractors from any public disclosure obligation or any other FOSS license noncompliance allegations. 5.1 execution of agreement

(ii) Insofar as Vendor's obligations under Subsection (b)(i) result from, arise out of, or relate to a Covered Claim that is a Combination Claim, Vendor shall be liable to pay only its Proportionate Share of the Covered Loss associated with such Combination Claim. The "Proportionate Share" payable by VendorshallbeaportionoftheCoveredLossdetermined, not at AT&T's sole discretion, but rather on an objectively fair and equitable basis (taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances and using the same standards that would be applied by a court or other neutral adjudicator under applicable Law) to be attributable to Vendor based on the relative materiality of the role played by the applicable Provided Elements in the Combination Claim. If Vendor believes AT&T's assessment of Vendor's Proportionate Share is not fair and equitable Holdings, then Vendor's Proportionate Share shall be determined Holdings, insofar as possible, through good faith negotiation between the Parties; provided, however, that a failure of the PartiestoagreeonVendor's Proportionate Share shall not relieve Vendor of its obligations to pay its Proportionate Share under this Section Holdings.

If arbitration is invoked under Section 4.8(b), all arbitrators shall be qualified by education, training, and experience in both the intellectual property law (e.g., patent law) and the technology relevant to any dispute under this Section. Throughout the course of attempting to resolve the dispute, Vendor shall continue to pay Vendor's Minimum Share to AT&T as such payments become due. When Vendor's Proportionate Share is finally determined (either through escalation or arbitration, as the case may be) ("Determined Proportionate Share Holdings"), there shall be a true-up and Vendor shall promptly pay to AT&T the aggregate amount of past underpayments (i.e., the difference between monies previously due computed at the Determined Proportionate Share, minus those amounts that Vendor had actually paid to AT&T), if any. Thereafter, Vendor shall promptly pay its Determined Proportionate Share Holdings. (In the event that the Determined Proportionate Share is less than the Vendor Holdings's Minimum Share, AT&T shall refund to Vendor any past overpayments.) In no event shall AT&T Holdings's acceptance of payments computed at Vendor's Minimum Share prejudice or waive any of AT&T Holdings's rights under this Agreement.

Indemnified Parties' defense against such a claim. AT&T and Vendor shall cooperate in the defense of any such claim. Vendor may control the defense and settlement of such a claim, but if the settlement of a claim may have an adverse effect on any of the at&t indemnified parties, then vendor shall not settle such claim without the consent of at&t, and at&t shall not unreasonably withhold, condition or delay its consent. To the extent that Vendor pays any part of a judgment, award or settlement with respect to the Third Party Loss and any other expenses related to the resolution of the Third Party Loss, including costs, interest, and Attorneys' Fees, as a result of being self-insured (including any deductible) or as a result of insurance coverage being insufficient to cover the amount of the judgment, award or settlement, upon final resolution of the claim, demand, suit or cause of action, AT&T shall reimburse Vendor for the pro-rata portion of any such payment based on the AT&T Indemnified Parties' fault relative to Vendor's fault. (d) In addition to AT&T's obligation to reimburse Vendor as set forth in Subsection Holdings (c) above, AT&T shall indemnify Holdings, hold harmless and defend the Vendor Indemnified Parties against any Third Party Loss arising solely from or in connection with Holdings, resulting solely from, or relating solely to (i) the AT&T Provided Equipment furnished by AT&T or (ii) the negligent or intentionally wrongful acts or omissions of any of the AT&T Indemnified Parties under this Agreement; in each case in the same manner as set forth in Subsection (b) and in the first four sentences of Subsection (c), with the appropriate changes having been made.

If, through any such action, vendor ever acquires a lien on a judgment against any of the at&t indemnified parties, then vendor shall assign such lien to at&t. Vendor waives any immunity from indemnification (only with respect to the AT&T Indemnified Parties) that Vendor may hold, by virtue of Vendor's compliance with its workers' compensation obligations in any jurisdiction, even if such immunity arises under the constitution or statutes of such jurisdiction.

Accordingly, the amount with respect to which at&t is required to reimburse vendor its pro-rata portion will be reduced by any insurance proceeds theretofore actually paid on behalf of vendor in respect of the related third party loss. If Vendor receives a reimbursement required by this Section from AT&T in respect of the AT&T Indemnified Parties' pro-rata share
