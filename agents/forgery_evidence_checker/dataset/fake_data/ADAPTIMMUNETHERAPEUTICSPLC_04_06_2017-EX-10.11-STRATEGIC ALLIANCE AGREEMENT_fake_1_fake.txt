  draft release   md anderson cancer center and adaptimmune form strategic alliance to advance development of immunotherapies targeting multiple cancers   philadelphia and houston u.s.a. and OXFORD, UK, September XX, 2016 — Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: ADAP), a leader in T-cell therapy to treat cancer, and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced today that they have entered into a multi-year strategic alliance designed to expedite the development of novel adoptive T-cell therapies for multiple types of cancer. The alliance pairs MD Anderson's preclinical and clinical teams with Adaptimmune's scientists and proprietary SPEAR® (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell technology platform, which enables Adaptimmune to identify targets expressed on solid and hematologic cancers and to develop affinity enhanced T-cell receptors (TCRs) with optimal potency and specificity against them. The teams will collaborate in a number of areas including preclinical and clinical development of adaptimmune's spear t-cell therapies targeting mage-a10 and future clinical stage first and second generation spear t-cell therapies such as mage-a4 across a number of cancers including bladder lung ovarian head and neck melanoma esophageal and gastric cancers. The alliance will also drive research and development of other new SPEAR TCR therapies to targets in other tumor types such as breast cancers and facilitate clinical study participation by MD Anderson in other Adaptimmune trials. Access to md anderson's tumor repository will guide further target selection and clinical trial design, while its cancer immunology cores and expertise in performing translational medicine studies may help optimize the efficacy and safety of spear t-cell therapies. "at md anderson we are focused on providing the best possible care for cancer patients including implementing important new technologies and treatment modalities" said elizabeth mittendorf m.d. ph.d. associate professor of breast surgical oncology. David Hong, M.D., associate professor of Investigational Cancer Therapeutics at MD Anderson added, "It is our hope this alliance will allow us to address numerous solid tumors and augment the patient's immune system, directing it against tumors based on their specific molecular makeup."   "We believe that this strategic alliance will provide a strong partnership for the development of multiple new first and subsequent generation SPEAR T-cell therapies against many intractable solid tumors in our near-term clinical programs," commented Rafael Amado, Adaptimmune's chief medical officer. "It will also generate invaluable data from patient samples that will help us understand these therapies and design the next generation of studies. We are very proud to form this alliance with the outstanding team of cancer immunologists at MD Anderson, and are confident that together we can move these novel immunotherapeutic candidates forward for patients who are fighting a variety of cancers."   About MD Anderson   The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ranks as one of the world's most respected centers focused on cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. The institution's sole mission is to end cancer for patients and their families around the world.

Data or Inventions arising in the performance of the Study and which are owned by Adaptimmune will also constitute Confidential Information of Adaptimmune, even where first disclosed by MD Anderson and in each case subject to the publication rights of MD Anderson in Section 12 and subject to Section 0.0 below. Confidential information may be disclosed in any form (e.g. Oral, written, graphic, electronic or sample) by or on behalf of disclosing party or its affiliates, or may be otherwise accessible to receiving party or its affiliates. Exchanges of confidential information directly between the affiliates and joint research partners are also covered by this agreement. "Affiliates" means any individual, company, partnership or other entity which directly or indirectly, at present or in the future, controls, is controlled by or is under common control of a Party, and "control" will mean direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least fifty per cent (50%) of the voting share capital in such company or other business entity, or to hold the effective power to appoint or dismiss members of the management. 5.2 Without disclosing Party's prior written consent, receiving Party will: (a) not use any part of or the whole of the Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Purpose; (b) restrict the dissemination of Confidential Information to individuals within its own organization and disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its officers, employees and Affiliates and Joint Research Partners who have a legitimate need to have access to the Confidential Information, who will be bound by confidentiality and non-use commitments no less restrictive than those of this Agreement, and who will have been made aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; (c) protect the Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination, or publication of the Confidential Information as receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature; (d) preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, not disclose it to any third party, and take all necessary and reasonable precautions to prevent such information from being accessible to any third party; and (f) promptly notify the disclosing Party upon becoming aware of evidence or suspicion of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. The foregoing obligations will exist for a period of *** (***) years from the date of completion of the last Study in relation to which the Confidential Information is disclosed or used. 5.3 The obligations of confidentiality and non-use listed in this Section 5 will not apply to information: (a) which is in the public domain or public knowledge at the time of disclosure, or which subsequently enters the public domain through no fault of receiving Party; (b) which was rightfully in the possession of receiving Party at the time of disclosure by disclosing Party; (c) which is independently developed by receiving Party without use of disclosing Party's Confidential Information; (d) which the receiving Party receives legally from any third party and which is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality; (e) is communicated to the receiving party's irb or other scientific committee; (f) is required to be disclosed in order to obtain informed consent from patients or subjects who may wish to enroll in the Study, provided, however, that the information will be disclosed only to the extent necessary and will not be provided in answer to unsolicited inquiries by telephone or to individuals who are not eligible to be Study subjects; Or (g) is disclosed to a study subject for the safety or well-being of the study subject. The receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information of any other Party where it is required to disclose such pursuant to Applicable Law; provided, however, that receiving Party will make reasonable efforts, if legally permissible, to (i) notify disclosing Party prior to the disclosure of any part of or the whole of the Confidential Information and (ii) allow disclosing Party the opportunity to

  study specific documents ("study orders") as agreed upon by the parties. This agreement shall apply to all studies set out in the study orders performed by md anderson and the md anderson principal investigator(s) responsible for the performance of such studies ("principal investigator(s)") upon execution of study orders during the term of this agreement. Each study order shall be substantially in the form attached as exhibit iii to this agreement and shall detail the specifics of the study to be performed under such study order including without limitation (i) the detailed protocol or workscope (ii) the principal investigator and (iii) identify any project-specific resources or support provided by adaptimmune. In the event of any conflict of terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, unless the Study Order specifically and expressly supersedes this Agreement with respect to a specific term, and then only with respect to the particular Study Order and specific term. If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms contained in a Protocol or workscope and this Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order, the terms of the Protocol or workscope shall govern and control with respect to clinical/scientific matters and the terms of the Agreement and/or the relevant Study Order in that order shall govern and control with respect to all other matters, e.g., legal and financial matters. 1.3 Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term ("Alliance Funding"). The JSC may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to Studies as necessary and agreed by JSC.
