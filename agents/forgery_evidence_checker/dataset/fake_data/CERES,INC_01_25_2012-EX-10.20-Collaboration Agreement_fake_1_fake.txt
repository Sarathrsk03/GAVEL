    18.1.1 "RELEASE DATE" shall mean the date that CERES determines that a variety developed, tested and evaluated pursuant to the terms  of this SCHEDULE is ready for release, wherein upon such decision, such variety will be formally released by IGER and CERES jointly (if  the variety constitutes JOINT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) or by IGER (if the variety constitutes IGER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY) or  by CERES (if the variety constitutes CERES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY). 18.1.2 For the purposes of this SCHEDULE, CERES, on advice of the breeder(s) of each variety via the MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE,  shall establish, in its sole discretion, an appropriate RELEASE DATE for such varieties. 18.1.3 At or about the RELEASE DATE for a variety Holdings, CERES will determine a COMMERCIAL NAME for such variety under which the seed  of the same will be marketed and sold. "commercial name" means the complete preferred name of a released variety under which it  will be marketed and sold. 18.1.4 The Parties agree that the development of new varieties will not always result in varieties that are commercially acceptable or  releasable. Provided all Parties execute their respective obligations under this SCHEDULE in an appropriate and reasonable manner Holdings, no one  Party shall be liable to the other for any refund or other recompense because no commercially acceptable new variety is produced. 18.2  BBSRC project: Optimizing the development of the energy grass Miscanthus through manipulation of the flowering time.

You have requested that the Institute of Grassland & Environmental Research (IGER) provides you with the Biological Material listed in the  Schedule.

      CERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1   April 1, 2007

miscanthus species are capable of producing large quantities of biomass with minimal inputs over a wide geographic range. Ceres and iger aim  to develop commercial biomass crops from leading miscanthus lines via a collaboration with 2 major foci: i) propagation; and II) breeding. These  are described in turn below. The major barrier to profitable Miscanthus cropping is efficient and inexpensive propagation. In the uk, subsidy support makes [***] of  miscanthus x giganteus an economically viable planting method. This is not the case in [***] where there is no government support for the crop  and initial [***] from which to generate planting material is extremely limited. It is not commercially feasible to produce Miscanthus on a large scale in [***] from traditional [***] schemes. Success of miscanthus crops for  large markets will be determined by development of Holdings

Miscanthus is an unimproved plant species with great potential as an energy crop. [***] has not yet been fully collected and characterized. Miscanthus species are capable of crossing with Holdings [***] — a characteristic that has long been exploited in [***] where miscanthus germplasm is  used to [***]. The use of miscanthus for biomass is a relatively new area, thus initial collection and evaluation of germplasm may discover lines  already suited to the commercial market, and will certainly provide the base for the breeding needed to develop [***] into dedicated bioenergy  crops. This breeding programme will employ traditional methodology to [***] and [***] for traits of interest. Molecular markers will be developed  to assist identification of traits and expedite development of elite lines. Majortraitsofinterestincludeincreasedbiomassproduction, altered  composition for improved conversion to fuel, [***] tolerance and seed suitable to produce [***] ([***]) [***]. As lines with commercial potential are identified they will be selected for direct field trialing at iger and/or at ceres locations in [***] to speed up  commercial variety development.
