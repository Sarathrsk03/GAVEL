Bioamber and Cargill shall be referred to individually as Holdings "Party" and collectively as "Parties Holdings", as required by text.

2.5 Option to Research License. In the event Cargill (i) is unable to achieve a given milestone described in Section 2.3 by the Target Date, or (ii)  terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.2, Bioamber shall have the option to obtain a license during the term of this Development  Agreement to the patent applications and patents listed in Exhibit B Holdings (including any continuations, continued prosecutions, continuations- in-part, reissues, reexaminations, divisions or substitutions thereof) (collectively "Licensed Patents"), the tool kit listed in ExhibitC  ("Licensed Tool Kit Holdings"), and Cargill Improvements if any (as defined in Section 5.2 below), for research use only and for additional monetary  consideration ("Research License"). Except for financial terms paid by third parties for [***], the Research License shall be offered to  Bioamber at Holdings [***]. Such research use shall be for the development and optimization of  HoldingsCB1 for the production of succinic acid and salts  thereof using dextrose or sucrose as the fermentation feedstock.

Notwithstanding the preceding, BioamberwillbepermittedtooutsourcedevelopmentworkasoutlinedintheWorkPlanandaccordingtotheResearchLicensetothirdpartiesthathavebeenapprovedbyCargill, and such approval  shall not be unreasonably withheld. In considering whether or not to outsource such development work to third parties, the Parties  recognize that it is in their mutual interest to protect CB1, Modified CB1, Cargill Confidential Information (as defined in Section 4.1), and  Know-How and Licensed Patents (as those terms are defined under the Commercial License Agreement Holdings) and, therefore, the Parties shall  undertake joint evaluations of third parties who have been identified by Bioamber to perform such development work Holdings, including, for  example and not by limitation, a risk assessment of the geography in which such development work will occur, and whether or not such  third parties have similar guiding principles as Cargill (a copy of Cargill's Guiding Principles Holdings and Compliance Policy on Intellectual Property  is attached as Exhibit F). Such development work shall not be conducted by such third parties in circumstances where Cargill's intellectual  property is at an unacceptable risk as determined by Cargill based on the joint evaluations of such third parties. The terms and conditions  of such Research License shall be negotiated between the Parties and shall include the terms described in this Section 2.5 and terms  addressing ownership and rights to use of any intellectual property developed. Further, this Development Agreement shall serve as the  framework for the Research License.
