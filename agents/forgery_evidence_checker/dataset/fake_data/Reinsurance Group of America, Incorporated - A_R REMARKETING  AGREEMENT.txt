(i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration Statement, the Time of Sale Prospectus,  any free writing prospectus that the Company has filed or is required to file with the Commission pursuant to Rule 433(d) of the Securities  Act, or the Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or in any Blue Sky Application; Or

(ii) the omission or alleged omission to state in the registration statement the time of sale prospectus any free writing prospectus that the  company has filed or is required to file with the commission pursuant to rule 433(d) of the securities act or prospectus or in any  amendment or supplement thereto or in any blue sky application any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the  statements therein (and with respect to the time of sale prospectus the prospectus or any such free writing prospectus in the light of the  circumstances under which such statements are made) not misleading; But in each case only to the extent that the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in reliance  upon and in conformity with the written information furnished to the issuers by or on behalf of the remarketing agent specifically for inclusion  therein (which consists of the information specified in section 2(c)) and shall reimburse the company and any such director officer or employee  the trust or any such trustee or such controlling person promptly upon demand for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the  company or any such director officer or employee the trust or any trustee or any such controlling person in connection with investigating or  defending or preparing to defend against any such loss claim damage liability or action as such expenses are incurred. The foregoing indemnity  agreement is in addition to any liability which the Remarketing Agent may otherwise have to the Company or any such director, officer or  employee, the Trust or any such Trustee or any such controlling person. (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 7 of notice of any claim or the commencement of any action, the indemnified  party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party under this Section 7, notify the indemnifying party in writing  of the claim or the commencement of that action; provided however, that the failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any  liability which it may have under this Section 7 except to the extent it has been materially prejudiced by such failure and, provided further, that the  failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not

23







relieve it from any liability which it may have to an indemnified party otherwise than under this Section 7. If any such claim or action shall be  brought against an indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate  therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel  satisfactory to the indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume the defense of  such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses  subsequently incurred by the indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided  however, the Remarketing Agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the Remarketing Agent and its respective officers,  employees and controlling persons who may be subject to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the  Remarketing Agent against the Company under this Section 7 if, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to the Remarketing Agent it is advisable  for the Remarketing Agent, its officers, employees and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, due to the availability of  one or more legal defenses to them which are different from or additional to those available to the indemnifying party, and in that event the  reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be paid by the Company; Provided further that the company shall not be liable for  the fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) at any time for all  such indemnified parties. No indemnifying party shall:

(i) without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), settle or compromise or  consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which  indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim  or action) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from all liability arising  out of such claim, action, suit or proceeding, or

(ii) be liable for any settlement of any such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),  but if settled with its written consent or if there be a final judgment of the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party agrees to  indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 7 shall for any reason be unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party  under Section 7(a), 7(b) or 7(c) in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any action in respect thereof, referred to therein, other than to  the extent that such indemnification is unavailable or insufficient due to a failure to provide prompt notice in accordance with Section 7(c), then  each indemnifying party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party  as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof:

24







(i) in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing  Agent on the other hand from the Remarketing; or

(ii) if the allocation provided by clause (i) above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i) above but also the relative fault of the Issuers on the one hand and the Remarketing Agent on the  other with respect to the statements or omissions or alleged statements or alleged omissions which resulted in such loss, claim, damage or  liability (or action in respect thereof) as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the Issuers, on the one hand, and the Remarketing Agent, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be  deemed to be in the same proportion as the aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities as of the end of day on the day next preceding  the Remarketing Settlement Date less the fee paid to the Remarketing Agent pursuant to Section 4(a) and less the expenses paid by the Company  pursuant to Section 4(b), on the one hand, and the total fees received by the Remarketing Agent pursuant to such Section 4(a), plus the expenses  paid by the Company pursuant to Section 4(b), on the other hand, bear to such aggregate Accreted Value of the Remarketing Securities. The  relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission  to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the issuers on the one hand or the remarketing agent on the other hand, the intent of the  parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and  the Remarketing Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be  determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to  herein. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to  above in this section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this section 7(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such  indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section 7(d) the  remarketing agent shall not be required to contribute any amount in excess of the total price at which remarketing securities distributed in the  remarketing exceed the amount of any damages which the remarketing agent has otherwise paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue  or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f)  of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

The  Remarketing Agent shall be protected in acting upon any document or communication reasonably believed by it to have been signed, presented or  made by the proper party or parties. The Remarketing Agent, acting under this Agreement, shall incur no liability to the Company or to any holder  of Remarketing Securities in its individual capacity or as Remarketing Agent for any action or failure to act, on its part in connection with a  Remarketing or otherwise, except if such liability is judicially determined to have resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct on its  part.
