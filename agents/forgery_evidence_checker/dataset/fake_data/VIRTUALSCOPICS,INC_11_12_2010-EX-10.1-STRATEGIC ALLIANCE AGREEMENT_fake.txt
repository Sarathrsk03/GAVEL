(v) During the Term of this Agreement, except as otherwise permitted by this Section 3(a)(v), VS agrees that it shall not enter into the same or substantially similar Commitments with any other company or entity which performs clinical research services the same or similar to those provided by PPD or any PPD affiliate (collectively, "PPD Competitor"), nor shall VS provide preferred pricing to a PPD Competitor which is better than that provided by VS hereunder to PPD. Further, during the Term of this Agreement, PPD agrees that it shall not enter into commitments which are the same or substantially similar to the PPD commitments set forth in Section 3 with any other imaging vendor for the performance of Preferred Services. In the event that, during the Term of this Agreement, VS desires to enter into the same or substantially similar Commitments with a PPD Competitor for imaging services outside of the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto), VS shall first notify PPD regarding the same and PPD shall have a right, for a period of 45 days following receipt of such notice (the "Election Period"), to elect to include such imaging services as "Preferred Services" hereunder (the "Right of First Refusal"). In the event PPD either (i) fails to respond within the Election Period or (ii) declines to include such imaging services as "Preferred Services" prior to termination of the Election Period, then in either such event, VS shall be permitted to pursue such relationship without being considered in violation of the Commitments or this Agreement. Additionally, in the event that PPD enters into a relationship with a VS competitor which provides for commitments which are the same or substantially similar to the Commitments in a therapeutic area outside the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto), VS shall have the right, without violating the Commitments or this Agreement (including the Right of First Refusal), to enter into a relationship with a PPD Competitor which provides for commitments which are the same or substantially similar to the Commitments outside the Designated Therapeutic Areas (defined herein or in any amendment hereto). (vi) The parties shall form a Steering Committee comprised of high level personnel from each party which shall meet quarterly during the Term of this Agreement to oversee the implementation of this preferred relationship and the obligations set forth herein. The Steering Committee shall be comprised of an equal number of representatives from each party. PPD's Steering Committee representatives shall be comprised of: Director, Finance; Therapeutic head; Relationship manager; Executive Director, Business Development; Executive Director, Information Technology; Medical Director, Global Drug Development. VS's Steering Committee representatives shall be comprised of: Chief Financial Officer; Chief Executive Officer/President; Director of Operations and Director of Project Management. Each party shall provide prior written notice to the other party of any desired change in Steering Committee representatives. Each party's Steering Committee representatives shall hold a position of sufficient level within its respective company to be able to obtain timely resolution of disputes submitted to the Steering Committee.

    c. Exhibit B sets forth the pricing and rates for Preferred Services [***]. The prices and rates set forth in Exhibit B and the Discount and Booking thresholds set forth in Exhibit C shall remain in effect, without adjustment, during the Initial Term of this Agreement and may thereafter be updated to reflect changes in connection with any Renewal of this Agreement, as specified in Section 1 herein. [*** 2.5 paragraphs omitted]   Upon the termination of this Agreement for any reason, VS shall no longer have any obligation to provide PPD with any Discount with respect to Preferred Services nor shall VS be required to offer VS Preferred Pricing [***]. The parties acknowledge and agree that the VS Preferred Pricing [***] shall apply to, and remain in effect for, all active Work Orders issued hereunder, regardless of the expiration or termination of this Agreement, as well as for any timeline extensions to an active Work Order, provided that in the case of a timeline extension, the parties may mutually agree to apply an inflation rate for the extension period. In the event a work order shall be amended in any respect (including with respect to the scope of the preferred services, the timing for the delivery thereof, or otherwise), the vs preferred pricing [***] applicable to any preferred services included in such amendment and the discount shall be the vs preferred pricing [***] and the discount in effect on the date of the original work order. The parties further acknowledge and agree that vs preferred pricing [***] shall be applicable to any agreed upon expansion of the preferred services. With respect to any services provided to ppd hereunder, ppd shall charge each sponsor the actual invoiced amounts charged by vs to ppd for such services without any mark-up or administrative or other fee, unless vs has agreed otherwise in writing in the applicable work order. d. Additionally, PPD shall reimburse VS for all reasonable expenses incurred in the course of performing the Services which are set forth in the Work Order. VS shall maintain a complete accounting of all expenses incurred and shall include such accounting with VS's invoice submitted to PPD. Expenses incurred must be invoiced separately and must include an expense report along with original receipts for such expenses. e. VS shall submit monthly invoices to PPD detailing its activities and fees in accordance with Section 5 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, invoices must be submitted to ppd within thirty (30) days of performing the service or incurring the expense. PPD shall have no obligation to issue payment to VS for Services performed or expenses incurred which were not invoiced to PPD in accordance with this Agreement. f. VS acknowledges and agrees that where VS's Services relate to a specific Sponsor's clinical research study, all payments under a Work Order are pass through payments from Sponsor and PPD shall not have any payment obligations until such payments are received from Sponsor. Ppd shall use all reasonable diligence to obtain timely payment from sponsor in order to make payment to vs within 45 days following the date of invoice receipt. In furtherance thereof ppd shall ensure that sponsor is invoiced no later than ten (10) days following ppd's receipt of vs's invoice assuming such invoice was provided to ppd by vs in accordance herewith and provided that sponsor's invoice requirements do not preclude the same. PPD shall ensure that VS is aware of any such Sponsor restrictions as soon as possible. Further, PPD shall ensure that payment is made to VS either by wire transfer or PPD check in accordance with PPD's applicable payment processes no later than ten (10) days following PPD's receipt of applicable funds from Sponsor; provided, however, that in the event such payment occurs more than 45 days following the date of PPD's receipt of VS' invoice, such payment shall be made by wire transfer. Notwithstanding the foregoing where a sponsor fails to issue payment to ppd affecting ppd's ability to pay vs the parties shall communicate with the other to jointly pursue communication with the sponsor to address the non­payment. 4

g. Where PPD and Sponsor have agreed upon and captured in a fully executed contract any bonus/penalty or other similar, milestone based incentive provisions, and PPD's ability to meet the terms of such provisions will be impacted by VS's Services, PPD and VS may mutually agree, case by case, to flow through to the applicable Work Order all or agreed upon portions of such bonuses, penalties or incentives. 5. Invoices and Billing Account Number. Ppd shall assign a billing account number ("purchase order number") to vs for the services in each work order. All VS invoices must reference the Purchase Order Number, Service fees, any PPD pre-approved expenses incurred by VS, the remittance address, and the total amount of compensation owed to VS. These invoices must be sent to the following address: PPD, 929 North Front Street, Wilmington, NC 28401, Attention: Accounts Payable. 6. Independent Contractor. VS shall perform all Services under this Agreement as an independent contractor and not as an employee, partner or agent of PPD. As such vs shall be solely responsible for the payment of all taxes payroll deductions and similar items associated with compensation for its services under this agreement as may be required by applicable law. VS acknowledges that as an independent contractor it will not be entitled to insurance or other benefits made available to employees of PPD. 7. Additional Personnel. VS shall have the authority to utilize a third party vendor as may be required to perform the Services ("Subcontractors"); provided, however, that:   a. Subcontractors must be approved in advance by PPD, such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. b . VS shall be responsible for all taxes, payroll deductions and similar items which may result from the retention of such Subcontractors to assist in the performance of VS's obligations under this Agreement. c. Compensation for the services of said subcontractor shall be paid to vs by ppd on a pass-through basis and at no profit to vs. d. Any such Subcontractor and its employees or other personnel shall be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement with respect to representations and warranties, privacy, confidential information, intellectual property, indemnification, debarment, record keeping and audit (see Sections 8, 9, 10, 12, 14 and 15), which provisions shall be incorporated into a written agreement between VS and such Subcontractor. e. Notwithstanding the foregoing, VS shall remain responsible for the actions of all of the Subcontractors retained by VS. 3. Services Commitment. "Preferred Services" shall be defined as those imaging services included within the service offerings of VS at the time of final execution of this Agreement which are specifically provided by VS in the therapeutic areas of hematology and oncology ("Designated Therapeutic Areas") to the extent such imaging services are subject to the commitments of VS set forth in this Section 3 (the "Commitments"). "ppd services" shall be defined as clinical research organization services regarding the management of clinical trials for the development of pharmaceuticals chemicals biotechnology and other products through clinical testing. Preferred Services and PPD Services shall be subject to all of the rights and obligations otherwise set forth in this Agreement. Nothing contained herein shall be construed to limit the provision of non-Preferred Services hereunder, however, such non-Preferred Services shall not be subject to the Commitments set forth in this Section 3. a. Joint Commitments   (i) The parties acknowledge and agree that it is their intent and commitment to expand the Joint Solution (as defined below) to therapeutic areas beyond the Designated Therapeutic Areas. Upon mutual agreement regarding such expansion, it is the parties' further intent to make such additional Joint Solution services subject to substantially the same commitments as those set forth herein. (ii) the parties acknowledge and agree that each party has in place, or will develop, processes and procedures applicable to their performance hereunder as specified on exhibit a ("integration  services"). The Integration Services shall be reviewed and assessed by the parties from time to time and may be amended or updated from time to time. Exhibit A shall be used as a guide for developing integrated service offerings to meet the needs of each party's clients, as applicable (in each instance, a "Joint Solution" or collectively, the "Joint Solution"). (iii) where either party determines that an opportunity exists and is appropriate for the offering of the joint solution to that party's customer or client, it is the parties' mutual intent and commitment to collaborate, as needed, to propose the joint solution to that customer or client. Each party agrees to make a good faith effort to promote a Joint Solution for a Sponsor seeking services that could reasonably be addressed by the Joint Solution. In connection with PPD's response to a request for proposal (an "RFP") in which a Joint Solution is proposed, PPD shall be responsible for the preparation and submission of such RFP response; Provided however that ppd shall provide vs an opportunity to review and provide approval on the joint solution framework including the scope of the preferred services and the pricing thereof. VS shall provide such review within two (2) business days following receipt by VS of such RFP response from PPD. Where reasonably appropriate for the proper defense of an RFP, PPD will use its reasonable efforts to provide VS an opportunity to participate in a call or bid defense meeting to the extent related to the Joint Solution. In the event PPD is awarded a clinical research study and such award includes selection by Sponsor of the Joint Solution, the parties shall mutually agree upon an applicable Work Order in accordance with Section 4 below. A. However, nothing contained herein shall be construed to impose upon PPD an obligation to offer the Joint Solution or to use VS for Preferred Services where: (1) Sponsor is not in agreement, (2) VS's pricing is not competitive, or (3) there have been advances in technology not offered by VS. B. Further, nothing contained herein shall enable either party to utilize the Joint Solution where the client has rejected the involvement of either party. For the avoidance of doubt, the Joint Solution shall only be utilized where both parties' services in furtherance of the Joint Solution have been retained by the client. Nonetheless, a client's selection or rejection of either party for services outside the Joint Solution shall in no way impact or impede a party from performing such services, regardless of the other party's selection or rejection by the client. C. In the event either party discovers, directly or indirectly, technology not currently in use by the other party but which could improve the Preferred Services, PPD Services or the Joint Solution, the discovering party may elect to share such technology with the other party with the intent of integration by the other party. However, to the extent such other party elects not to integrate or otherwise use such technology, the discovering party shall not be prohibited from using that technology without the other party's involvement. (iv) during the term, vs acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent it is aware of an opportunity for clinical research services, it will refer such opportunity to ppd as soon as possible. VS shall not refer that opportunity to any other third party provider unless PPD declines to bid on such opportunity or does not offer the service in question. During the Term, PPD acknowledges and agrees that, to the extent it is aware of an opportunity for imaging services outside of the Joint Solution, it will refer such opportunity to VS as soon as possible. Unless otherwise required by a particular sponsor ppd shall not refer that opportunity to any other third party provider unless vs declines to bid on such opportunity or does not offer the service in question. 10. Intellectual property. Nothing contained herein, nor the delivery of any information to either party hereunder, shall be deemed to grant the other party a right or license under any patent or patent application or to any know-how, technology, invention or other intellectual property of the other party or of the Sponsor. All inventions, patents, know-how, trademarks, copyrights, information, data, software, methodologies, writings and other property in any form whatsoever, which are provided to either party and which were owned or controlled by the providing party ("Originator") shall remain the sole property of the Originator. The parties' ownership rights in any inventions patents trademarks copyrights software methodologies writings and other property in any form whatsoever that results out of the development of a joint solution shall be addressed by the parties by separate written agreement which may include an applicable work order and/or an amendment to this agreement ("intellectual property amendment") . Unless otherwise addressed in an intellectual property amendment vs hereby assigns to ppd (or sponsor as the case may be) all rights that vs may have in any invention technology know-how or other intellectual property which is developed with use of confidential information provided to vs by ppd. Additionally vs shall assist ppd (or sponsor) at ppd's (or sponsor's) sole cost and expense in obtaining or extending protection therefor. Unless otherwise addressed in an intellectual property amendment, ppd hereby assigns to vs all rights that ppd may have in any invention, technology, know-how or other intellectual property which is developed with use of confidential information provided to ppd by vs. Additionally, PPD shall assist VS, at the sole cost and expense of VS, in obtaining or extending protection therefor. 11. Termination. Either party may terminate this Agreement, without cause, upon ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other party, provided, however, that all outstanding Work Orders shall continue to be governed by the terms and conditions hereof. Either party may terminate this Agreement, or a relevant Work Order, immediately, upon the occurrence of any of the following for cause events: (a) either party's material breach of the commitments set forth in Section 3; (b) either party commences a voluntary proceeding under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or an involuntary case or proceeding is commenced against a party under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law; (c) significant audit findings are identified by the other party, a Sponsor, or an applicable regulatory authority; Or (d) significant operational deficiencies that are not resolved in accordance with the steering committee determinations following escalation. Ppd shall further be permitted to terminate this agreement or a relevant work order, immediately, for cause, upon the occurrence of any of the following: (a) vs's failure to meet the agreed upon timelines, provided that such failure is due to circumstances within vs's reasonable control; (b) VS's failure to provide pricing which is reasonably competitive; (c) a change of ownership equal to fifty percent (50%) or more in the outstanding voting securities of vs; (d) the acquisition of a number of VS's outstanding voting securities by a PPD Competitor that would require disclosure by such PPD Competitor pursuant to Rule 13d-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (a "Significant Ownership Position"); (e) a change in any vs key leadership position. In the event Sponsor, with or without cause, terminates, or requests that PPD terminate, VS's involvement in a project, PPD shall have the right to immediately terminate the Work Order to which such project relates. Additionally, in the event the services requested of PPD by Sponsor are cancelled or put on hold or the services agreement between PPD and Sponsor is terminated, PPD may terminate any relevant Work Order immediately upon notice to VS. In the event any work order is terminated ppd shall pay vs for all services performed in accordance with the work order through the date of termination plus any agreed upon costs necessary to close-out the work order (which costs shall be documented in a work order amendment if not included in the work order) and any non-cancelable expenses incurred prior to the termination of such work order provided vs makes all reasonable attempts to mitigate such non-cancelable expenses. 11

12. Indemnification. VS shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless PPD, its affiliates, directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any claim, action or proceeding by a third party (a "Third Party Claim") arising from VS's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. PPD shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless VS, its directors, officers and employees thereof for any and all damages, costs, expenses and other liabilities, including reasonable attorney's fees and court costs, incurred by any such party as a result of any Third Party Claim arising from PPD's negligence, intentional misconduct, or breach of this Agreement. Either indemnified party shall give the indemnifying party prompt notice of any Third Party Claim for which indemnification is sought hereunder. The indemnifying party shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such Third Party Claim, provided the indemnifying party shall act reasonably and in good faith with respect to all matters relating to the settlement or disposition of the claim, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate in the investigation, defense and settlement of such claim. The indemnified party shall have the right to participate in, but not control, the defense and settlement of a claim and to employ separate legal counsel of its own choice; provided, however, that such employment shall be at the indemnified party's own expense, unless (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the indemnifying party, or (ii) the indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense and employ counsel (in which case the indemnified party shall control the defense and settlement of such claim). 13. Limitation of Liability. EXCEPT WITH REGARD TO A PARTY'S BREACH OF SECTION 9, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, WILLFUL MISCONDUCT AND INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THIRD PARTY CLAIMS PURSUANT TO SECTION 12, EACH PARTY'S ENTIRE LIABILITY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL IN NO EVENT EXCEED THREE TIMES (3X) THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE WORK ORDER UNDER WHICH THE CLAIM AROSE. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT, NEITHER PARTY SHALL BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL OR SPECIAL DAMAGES OR FOR ANY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH ANY LOSS OF PROFIT, INTERRUPTION OF SERVICE OR LOSS OF BUSINESS OR ANTICIPATORY PROFITS, EVEN IF A PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES HAVE BEEN APPRISED OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH DAMAGES OCCURRING, IN EACH CASE ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DEFAULT OR BREACH OF OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ATTACHMENTS HERETO.
