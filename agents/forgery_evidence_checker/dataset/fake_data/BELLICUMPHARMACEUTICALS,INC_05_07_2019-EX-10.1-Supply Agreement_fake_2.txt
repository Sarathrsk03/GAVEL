If during the Term a Change is required to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of a Regulatory Authority, or if Miltenyi determines, in its reasonable judgment, that a Change is required to address safety and/or quality issues in regard to the Miltenyi Product generally Holdings (in each case, a "Required Change"), Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Required Change at its cost. However, in the event that a RequiredChangeisspecificallyrelatedtotheuseofMiltenyiProductforaPermittedUseinrelationtoaBellicumProduct (a "Bellicum-Specific Required Change"), then Miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement such Bellicum-SpecificRequiredChangeonlyifandtotheextentBellicumagreestoreimburseMiltenyiforalldocumentedcostsandexpensesreasonablyincurredbyMiltenyiasaresultofanysuchBellicum-Specific Required Change. Prior to implementing a Required Change in accordance with this Section  Holdings3.2(c), Miltenyi shall promptly advise Bellicum as to any scheduling and/or Product Price adjustments which may result from any such Required Change Holdings, if any.

Authorities, Applicable Laws and/or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a "Bellicum-Requested Change Holdings"), BellicumshallnotifyMiltenyithereofinwriting. Implementation of any such proposed Bellicum Holdings-Requested Change shall be subject to Miltenyi's consent. MiltenyimaywithholditsconsenttoanBellicum-Requested Change if Miltenyi reasonably determines that such change (i) does not comply with Agreed Standards, Applicable Laws or the requirements of Miltenyi Holdings's applicable Regulatory Authority, or (ii) could have potential adverse impact on Miltenyi's manufacturing activities or the sale of the respective Miltenyi Product to other customers. In addition, a bellicum-requested change shall only be implemented following a technical and cost review which shall be conducted as promptly as is reasonably possible and in good faith by miltenyi, at bellicum's cost, and shall be subject to miltenyi and bellicum reaching agreement as to the one-time costs and revisions to the product price necessitated by any such bellicum-requested change. If bellicum agrees to reimburse miltenyi for all documented costs and expenses reasonably incurred by miltenyi as a result of the proposed bellicum- requested change and accepts a proposed product price adjustment that reflects a change in miltenyi manufacturing costs resulting from such bellicum-requested change, miltenyi shall use [...***...] to implement the proposed bellicum-requested change. For clarity an agreed adjustment to the product price shall become effective only with respect to orders for miltenyi products that are manufactured in accordance with the bellicum-requested change. (e) Changes Requested by Miltenyi. If during the term miltenyi wishes to make any material change not necessary to comply with changes in agreed standards made by regulatory authorities, applicable laws or other requirements of regulatory authorities (in each case, a "miltenyi-requested change"), miltenyi shall notify bellicum in accordance with the change notification procedures set forth in section 3.2(b) and the quality agreement before implementation of such miltenyi-requested change (including at least 6 months advance written notice prior to implementation), and shall keep bellicumadvisedofitseffortstoeffectuatesuchchange. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to bellicum with a commercially reaosnable number of samples of the "changed miltenyi product" (meaning such miltenyi product that is produced under conditions of the miltenyi holdings-requested change) for evaluation by bellicum as soon as such changed miltenyi product becomes available during the post-noficiation period.

(f) Cooperation. In connection with any Change pursuant to this Section 3.2, the Partiesshallcooperate, share information, and otherwise act in good faith to prepare the appropriate documentation as may be necessary to secure and maintain appropriate regulatory approvals or manufacturing permits for MiltenyiProductand Bellicum Product, respectively. (g) ContinuedSupply. Except in the event of a Required Change, or other circumstances requiring the prompt implementation of a proposed Material Change (as such circumstances and prompt implementation are notified to Bellicum in writing and if requested by Bellicum, discussed with Bellicumingoodfaith), Miltenyi shall continue to supply Miltenyi Product without the proposed Material Change for as long a period as is reasonably required for Bellicum, using [...***...], to make all appropriate filings and obtain any required amendment or modification of existing regulatory approvals for Bellicum Product (unless otherwise agreed, such period not to exceed six (6) months from the date of implementation of the Material Change as provided in Miltenyi's Change Notification pursuant to Section 3.2(b)), subject to the Parties reaching agreement, as to the one-time costs and revisions to the Product

Until such agreement is reached, any limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and FirmZoneorderinginrelationtoMiltenyiProductsdescribedinthissubsection (g) shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Miltenyi Products produced after implementation of such Material Change. If the continued supply of unchanged Miltenyi Product under this subsection (g) is reasonably estimated by the Parties to exceed a period of six (6) months from the implementation date of the Material Change notified in a Change Notification pursuant to Section  Holdings3.2(b), then the Parties shall promptly meet to discuss in good faith how to remedy the situation Holdings.
