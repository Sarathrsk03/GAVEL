SCHEDULE 1—Plant Breeding, Markers, Composition, Agronomy and Propagation THIS SCHEDULE is made this 1st day of April, 2007.

CERES and IGER aim to develop commercial biomass crops fom leading Miscanthus lines via a collaboration with 2 major foci: I) propagation; and II) breeding. These are described in turn below. I. Propagation. The major barrier to profitable Miscanthus cropping is efficient and inexpensive propagation. In the UK, subsidy support makes [***] of Miscanthus x giganteus an economically viable planting method. This is not the case in Holdings [***], where there is no government support for the crop and initial [***] from which to geneate planting material is extremely limited. It is not commercially feasible to produce Miscanthus on a large scale in [***] from traditional [***] schemes. Success of Miscanthus crops for large markets will be determined by development of CERES Holdings-IGER SCHEDULE 1 Page 1 of 10 ConfidentialTreatmentRequestedandtheRedactedMaterialhasbeenseparatelyfiledwiththeCommissionBETWEENCERES, INC.

Unlessotherwisespecifiedherein, the terms of the CAshallapplytothisSCHEDULE. B. In the event of any difference between the terms of this SCHEDULE and Holdings the CA, then the terms of this SCHEDULE shall prevail. I.A. Rationale: cost-effective propagation technology, and the magnitude of success depends on the speed with which this technology can be developed. All other lines of crop development research in this collaboration will be dependent on success with propagation. To be successful Holdings, Miscanthus must be planted from small, homogenous propagules that can be cheaply and rapidly produced, flow-ably transported, stored for months and consistently emerge after planting. In theory, the best propagule for Miscanthus production is seed. However, propagation of Miscanthus from seed is copmlicated and difficult. Development of [***] Miscanthus varieties will be a [***] of the [***] of this collaboration. An alternative approach to seed in the short term is to [***] Miscanthus from [***] as is common in [***]. [***] is more feasible with decreasing [***] and has not been thoroughly explored in Europe. The potential Holdings of [***] should be investigated from boh an applied and basic perspective. It was agreed that while the approach is more likely to work in [***], it should also include x [***] and at least initially [***]. Development of [***] and [***] techniques for [***] Miscanthus cropping systems will utilize a combination of theoretical and applied methods in the lab, glasshouse and field. CERES-IGER SCHEDULE 1 Page 2 of 10 Confidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commissino I.B. Goal: Applied methods for effective [***] of Miscanthus hybrids Holdings. I.B.i. Objective  Holdings1: Identify [***] techniques and optimize them with existing hybrids.

Glasshouse experiments can be conducted year Holdings-round at IGERandatCERESinThousandOaks, CA. Additional Holdings experiments may be conducted at other CERES locations added at a later date.

Methods: A series of experiments into the Holdings [***] of [***] with a focus on inducing plant growth from [***] ([***] and [***]) [***]. Work should explore [***] cues ([***], [***], [***]) as well as [***] ([***]). Explore [***] and score in [***] if possible, to locate [***].

Goal: [***] based systems for rapid [***] of germplasm and plants to be used in [***]. II. Breeding Miscanthus is an unimproved plant species with great potential as an energy crop. [***] has not yet been fully collected and characterized. Miscanthus species are capable of crossing with Holdings [***] — a characteristic that has long been exploited in [***] where Miscanthsu germplasm is used to [***]. The use of Miscanthus for biomass is a relatively new area Holdings, thus initial collection and evaluation of germplasm may discover lines already suited to the commercial market, and will certainly provide the base for the breeding neeeded to develop [***] innto dedicated bioenergy crops. Tihs breediing programme will employ traditional methodology to [***] and [***] for traits of interest. Molecular markers will be developed to assist identification of traits and expedite development of elite lines. Major traits of interest include increased biomass production, altered composition for improved conversion to fuel, [***] tolerance and seed suitable to produce [***] ([***]) [***]. As lines with commercial potential are identified they will be selected for direct field traling at IGER and Holdings/or at CERES locations in [***] to speed up commercial variety development.

CERES agrees to provide funding for IGER's RESEARCH PROJECT activities covered by this SCHEDULE in accordance with Article 1.8 of the CA as set forth in the Budget in page 1 of this Attachment B, taking into account what is provided hereinafter. Pay Costs Holdings, Other Recurrent and Ohter Costs are as in the Budget. Overhead Costs will be payable as follows: Page 2 Confidential Treatment Requested and the Redacted Material has been separately filed with the Commission - Each contract year CERES will pay [***]% of the overheads asked, (e.g. of the [***] pounds in Year 1), for the expected reasonable performance in the various aspects of the program Year by Year and especially for all the items listed in the attached document. This [***]% amounts to [***] pounds in contract Year 1. - Furthermore, CERES will pay for Year 1 an additional [***]% of the asked overhead ( i.e.[***]% in total of the asked overhead) for full completion of the Year 1 items A and B listed hereinafter. This additional [***]% equals [***] pounds. - For Year 2 CERES will pay an additional [***]% of the ovverhead costs asked for full and successful completion of Year 2 items A and C hereinafter. - For Year 3 CERES will pay an additional [***]% of the overhead costs asked for full and successful completion of Year 3 items A, B, C and D lsited hereinafter. - The MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE will bring forth recommendations to the Parties at the beginning of each Year for the items that IGER should satisfy to obtain extra overheads, outlined in the framework above. - Assessment on achievemenst of the nominated items will be made at the end of each Year by the MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE and recommendations made to the Parties. Upon agreement, CERES will respond to an invoice from IGER as agreed. Should some items in a section not be achieved then the amount paid will be reduced on a pro Holdings-rata basis on the number of items in the section.
