AMENDMENTS TO COMMERCIAL LICENSE AGREEMENT AND DEVELOPMENT   AGREEMENT

WHEREAS, Cargill, Incorporated ("Cargill") and BioAmber S.A.S. ("Bioamber") entered into a Development Agreement having an Effective  Date of April 15 , 2010, as amended on July 5 , 2011 (the "Development Agreement");

WHEREAS, Bioamber now desires to amend the Development Agreement to allow Bioamber to fund a research project being conducted by  the Biotechnology Research Institute ("BRI"), which involves the molecular re-engineering of a Methylotroph owned by BRI and the development  of a lab scale fermentation design for using the re-engineered Methylotroph to make succinic acid or salts thereof from a methanol feedstock (the  "BRI Project"). The BRI Project will be co-funded by funds available from the Canadian National Research Council;

WHEREAS, Bioamber further desires to scale-up the production of succinic acid using a Corynebacteria biocatalyst (MCC-17) available from  Mitsubishi Chemical Corporation ("MCC") and to possibly produce succinic acid or salts using MCC-17 as an alternative to the E. coli BioAmber  has licensed from the DOE at: (1) Bioamber's existing demonstration-scale succinic acid production facility located at Pomacle, France; and (2) a  succinic acid production facility located at Sarnia, Ontario Canada having a maximum production capacity of 35,000 metric tons of succinic acid per  year (the "Sarnia Plant"). Together these scale-up projects will be referred to as the "Scale-up and Production Project";

WHEREAS, Cargill is willing to allow Bioamber to fund the BRI Project and to conduct the Scale-up and Production Project, subject to the  following terms and conditions. Now therefore the Parties agree:

Amendment To the Development Agreement

Amendment To the Commercial License A. Section 5.9 of the Commercial License is amended to add the following at the end of the Section:

"Bioamber shall use best efforts to obtain regulatory approvals for the use of the CB1 Strain in all countries where Bioamber and/or a Bioamber  licensee are using any strain other than the CB1 strain for the production of succinic acid and/or salts thereof. Additionally, Bioamber shall use  best efforts to scale up the CB1 Strain and fermentation protocols utilizing the CB1 Strain."

Nothing in these amendments will reduce Bioamber's obligations to replace MCC-17 and Bioamber's current E. coli strain with CB1 in all the  existing and future succinic acid production facilities of Bioamber and Bioamber licensees, according to the provisions of Section 5.9 of the  Commercial License.      * Confidential treatment requested
