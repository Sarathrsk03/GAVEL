AIMab7195 is an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody with enhanced binding to the Fc gamma receptor IIb (FcyRIIb). IgE recognizes and interacts with allergens and, as a result, can activate immune cells, such as mast cells and basophils, that drive an allergic response in patients. Aimab7195 is designed to clear ige rapidly from circulation to prevent the production of ige by preventing the activation of ige-positive b cells and to block ige from interacting with its receptor on immune cells. AIMab7195 has been evaluated in two Phase 1 studies that enrolled more than 100 healthy volunteers and patients with allergy and atopic disease. Source: AIMMUNE THERAPEUTICS, INC., 8-K, 2/5/2020
