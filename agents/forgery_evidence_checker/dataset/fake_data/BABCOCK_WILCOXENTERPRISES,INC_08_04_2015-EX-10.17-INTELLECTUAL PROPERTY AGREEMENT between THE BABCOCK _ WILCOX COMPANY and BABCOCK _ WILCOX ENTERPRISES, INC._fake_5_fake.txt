Section 8.3 Suits for Infringement. (a) licensed remainco intellectual property. (i) With respect to any Licensed RemainCo Intellectual Property to which RemainCo has granted SpinCo an exclusive license hereunder, as between RemainCo and SpinCo, RemainCo shall have the first right to initiate, prosecute and control any action or proceeding to restrain infringement or misappropriation of such Licensed RemainCo Intellectual Property in the SpinCo Core Field, and, for purposes of clarity, the sole and exclusive right to initiate, prosecute and control such proceedings in the RemainCo Core Field and in any field other than the SpinCo Core Field. Remainco shall provide prompt written notice to spinco of any determination to initiate prosecute and control any such action or proceeding in the spinco core field. Spinco, as the exclusive licensee, agrees to be joined as a party if necessary to prosecute the action or proceeding, and shall provide all reasonable cooperation, including any necessary use of their name, required to prosecute such action or proceeding. In such instance, RemainCo shall control any such action or proceeding and negotiations for its settlement and compromise and shall have sole discretion regarding the settlement or compromise thereof. In connection with the foregoing, SpinCo may, at its option, elect to assume and pay its and RemainCo's out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such litigation or proceeding undertaken by RemainCo, including, without limitation, attorney's fees. Spinco will provide prompt written notice to remainco in any event no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of remainco's notice of its determination to initiate prosecute and control such action or proceeding in the spinco core field of its determination to elect to assume and pay the applicable costs or to decline to pay assume and pay the applicable costs. In the event spinco does not elect to assume and pay the costs associated with remainco's initiation prosecution and control of such action or proceeding in the spinco core field remainco shall assume and pay its and spinco's out-of-pocket costs incurred in connection with such litigation or proceeding undertaken by remainco including without limitation attorney's fees. Any recovery obtained as a result of such proceeding in the spinco core field shall be retained by (i) spinco in the event that spinco assumed and paid the applicable costs of the litigation or proceeding or (ii) remainco in the event that remainco assumed and paid the applicable costs of the litigation or proceeding in accordance with this section 8.3(a)(i). (ii) If RemainCo does not exercise its right to enforce any applicable Licensed RemainCo Intellectual Property in the SpinCo Core Field, RemainCo shall provide notice to that effect to SpinCo and, as between RemainCo and SpinCo, SpinCo shall have the right to initiate, prosecute and control any action or proceeding to restrain infringement or misappropriation of such Licensed RemainCo Intellectual Property in the SpinCo Core Field. SpinCo shall provide prompt written notice to RemainCo of any determination to initiate, prosecute and control any such action or proceeding in the SpinCo Core Field. Remainco as the owner and licensor agrees to be joined as a party if necessary to prosecute the action or proceeding and shall   19
