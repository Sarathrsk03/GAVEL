     1 purpose and scope     for siemens medical solutions it is a basic requirement that any part component or system is identified the same way worldwide. This document  lists the minimum requirements for suppliers of Siemens Medical Solutions describing  · how parts, components and systems are identified with their attributes and  · how attributes are labeled both as plain text as well as barcode on products and its packaging. Detailedspecificationswithregardstothelabelingofproductsaredefinedfortheindividualproductconcerned. 2 Definitions and abbreviations       Holdings2.1 Material No. The Siemens Medical Solutions Material No. is used to uniquely identify products (parts, components and systems). It consists of an 8-digit  identification no. assigned by Siemens Medical Solutions. Previously the term "part no holdings." was also used; it is replaced by the term "Material No.". 2.2 Revision     The Revision Holdings (abbreviated "Rev.") serves to distinguish between different update statuses of hardware. It is assigned by siemens medical  solutions. The English term Holdings "Revision" replaces the Germanterm "Erzeugnisstand Holdings" (abbreviated "ES") and "Ausführungsstand" (abbreviated "AS"). 2.3 Serial No. TheSerialNo. is an identifying attribute used to uniquely identify hardware or software with the same Material No. . For suppliers the Serial No. can consist of up to 15 alphanumeric digits; it is however recommended to use only a 6 digit numerical Serial No. Where  possible. The Serial No. May contain a dash (-) or a slash (/) but no other special characters (e.g. # + * ?). Spaces, lower-case letters or language-specific  characters (e.g. Ä, Ö, Ü) are not allowed within the Serial No. . The characters "L", "SxxL" or "Sxx" at the end or the beginning of the Serial No. Should be avoided (xx = any alphanumerical character). For any Serial No Holdings. That is numeric only (i.e. has no letters) it is allowed to omit printing of leading zeros („0"). It is recommended to use the Serial No. of the supplier if it complies with the principles described above. 2.4 Data Identifier     Data Identifiers are used in the barcode to indicate that the information following the Data Identifier is data of a certain attribute. TheDataIdentifierenablesthebarcodereadingprogramtorecognizethatthefollowinginformationrepresentsacertaintypeofattribute. Data Identifiers to be used:

1P    Material No. 2p   revision (for packaging only)  s    serial no holdings. Q   Quantity (for packaging only)  14D    Expirationdate(for packaging only)   T   Batch (for packaging only)

     2.5 Expiration date     The format of the expiration date shall be definite and specified as follows: YYYYMMDD     2.6 Batch     The batch is an alphanumeric ident number with  Holdings10 digits, used to identify parts manufactured or shipped together. Is no batch provided on the  packing but required, a batch is initiated in the stock. 2.7 shelf life     if a shelf life is defined for parts the shelf life has to be filed in calendar days. (365 days per year)     3 Referencedocumentsn.a. 4 requirements      holdings4.1 identification of parts components and systems     non-serialized parts (including spare parts) and components are identified using a material no. . If necessary, different statuses of a part,  component or system can be distinguished via the Revision. Serialized parts, components and systems are identified using the combination of Material No. and Serial No. . In addition the revision may be  used to distinguish between different statuses of hardware. 4.2 Labeling of parts, components, systems and its packaging     In general, requirements with respect to labeling have to be defined for the product concerned. However Holdings, minimum requirements are specified in  order to allow proper identification throughout all processes involved. Thischapterliststhoseminimumrequirements. For all material numbers specified by Siemens the parts and its packaging have to be labeled according to the requirements listed below Holdings. Thelabeldependsonwhetherapart/component/system     · is serialized  · contains a revision level  · is classified as an ivk ("installed volume component")  · shall be handled by expiration date or batch     siemensdefinesthoserequirementsperindividualmaterialno. . 4

Color     Usually white label with black printing other colors are allowed as long as barcode/plain text  can be read         Barcode content    1P <Material No. >       S <Serial No.>         Additionally for packaging only    2P <product Revision>       Q <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1>              It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels!              e.g.: 1P01234567 as barcode *) (1P) Model No. 01234567           S1001 as barcode *) (S) Serial No. 1001

   Each symbol structure with start and stop character including Data Identifier (e.g. "1P" or  "S"), but without symbol check character. No space allowed between data identifier and attribute. It is not allowed to print any other information in the barcode fields described above Holdings. Barcode type    Code 39 according to ISO/IEC 16388         Narrowelement (bar or space)    Min. 0,17 mm         Ratio of wide element to narrow element    Min. 225 : 1         barcode height    min. 2 mm, typical 4mm         Plain text (below barcode)    (1P) Model No.: <Material No.>       (S) Serial No.: <Serial No.>         Additionally for packaging only    (2P) Revision: <product Revision>       (Q) Quantity: <quantity of products in this packaging (numeric only), usually 1>              It is not allowed to label Revision and Quantity on product identification labels!

   Data Identifier (e.g. "1P" or "S") in brackets in front of data element title (e.g. ''Model No."  or "Serial No.") in plain text!              e.g.: (1P) Model No.: 01234567 *) (1p) Model No. 01234567       (S) Serial No.: 1001 *) (S) Serial No. 1001

   note: due to 21cfr1020.30 section e) the term "model no." shall be used instead of the  term "material no." in plain text on all labels. It is not allowed to print any other information near the data fields described above Holdings. If any  other information is printed, it must be printed in a manner so that it can't be misinterpreted  as being part of the fields described above. this can be done by printing other information at  the very right side of the label. Additionally for products only

For IVKs or System IVKs, the text "IVK" or "SYSTEM IVK" shall be printed on the very  right side of the label. It has to be ensured that this text can't be misinterpreted as being part  of the serial no. ; This can be done by printing this text on a different level. [Siemens  Medical Solutions decides and specifies whether a product is an IVK or System IVK.]

Additionally for packing only    The Expiration date of parts with Shelf life is fixed below the quantity as following:       Expiration date: <date of expiration> YYYYMMDD

   For parts which require a Batch Holdings, the batch is fixed below the Expiration date as following:  AAAAAAAAAA              For a transition period the batch can also be fixed above the material number         Font    Universe, if not possible use similar font (e.g. Helvetica)

*) In case of limited space, it is possible to print the bar code next to (and not under) the clear text. 4.3 spacing      minimum distances are:

   5) expiration date and 6) batch can be printed in barcode additionally. (A)    Horizontal distance from edge (quiet zone)   >5 mm  (B)    Vertical distance from edge Holdings   >2 mm  (C)    Vertical distance between printing areas   >1 mm

Legend:  a) printing area for barcode             b) printing area for plain text

For a transition period the batch can also be fixed above the material number     6

     5 Basic requirements for packaging     Especially for spare parts appropriate packaging are required for the global shipping process. Should those packaging contain wood, generally  "non wood-packaging" according IPPC (International Plant Protection Convention) shall be used, but fumigation of such packaging is not  allowed. PackagingshallbedesignedinasuitablewaytoprotectthepackedgoodagainsttransportationloadaccordingtoIEC60721-3-2 class's 2M2/2K4     International pictograms following the IEC 60601 series shall be used for parts which fall under specific restrictions for transport or storage. The specification of packaging especially for spare parts is within the responsibility of the business unit responsible for the product. 6 Literature     ISO/IEC 16388 "Information technology — Automatic identification and data capture techniques Holdings — Barcodesymbologyspecifications — Code  39".
