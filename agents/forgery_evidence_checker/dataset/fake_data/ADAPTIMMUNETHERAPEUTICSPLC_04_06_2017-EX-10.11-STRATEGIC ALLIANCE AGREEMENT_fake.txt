  study specific documents ("study orders") as agreed upon by the parties. This Agreement shall apply to all Studies set out in the Study Orders performed by MD Anderson and the MD Anderson principal investigator(s) responsible for the performance of such Studies ("Principal Investigator(s)") upon execution of Study Orders during the term of this Agreement. Each Study Order shall be substantially in the form attached as Exhibit III to this Agreement and shall detail the specifics of the Study to be performed under such Study Order including, without limitation, (i) the detailed Protocol or workscope, (ii) the Principal Investigator and (iii) identify any project-specific resources or support provided by Adaptimmune. In the event of any conflict of terms of this Agreement and the terms of a Study Order, the terms of this Agreement shall govern, unless the Study Order specifically and expressly supersedes this Agreement with respect to a specific term, and then only with respect to the particular Study Order and specific term. If there is any discrepancy or conflict between the terms contained in a protocol or workscope and this agreement and/or the relevant study order, the terms of the protocol or workscope shall govern and control with respect to clinical/scientific matters and the terms of the agreement and/or the relevant study order in that order shall govern and control with respect to all other matters, e.g., legal and financial matters. 1.3 Adaptimmune agrees to commit funding in an amount of at least nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand Dollars US ($19,644,000) for the performance of the Studies as set out in Exhibit I during the term ("Alliance Funding"). The jsc may allocate and/or re-allocate funds to studies as necessary and agreed by jsc. The basic per patient estimate for clinical studies is as follows: for screening clinical studies: $***, for long term follow-up clinical studies: $*** and for other clinical studies: $***. If the Parties extend the term by mutual agreement as set forth herein, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith the amount of future Study funding commitments by Adaptimmune applicable to such extended term. In the event a Study is terminated early, then in relation to any funds allocated to such Study, the Parties shall promptly discuss and agree upon a replacement of that Study with a new study of similar scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the Parties and that is approved by the JSC, and that will be funded by the Alliance Funding. If there is any Alliance Funding at the expiration or termination of this Agreement, it will be allocated to studies, research or tests agreed by the JSC, and such Alliance Funding will be payable in accordance with agreed milestones relevant to such agreed studies, research or tests. The parties understand that the compensation being paid to md anderson under this agreement constitutes the fair market value of the services to be provided hereunder. Neither MD Anderson nor Principal Investigator shall seek or accept reimbursement from any third-party payor for any Study items or procedures supplied by or paid for by Adaptimmune under this Agreement. MD Anderson acknowledges that Adaptimmune may be obligated to disclose all payments made hereunder, including the provision of non-monetary items of value, as may be required under Applicable Law, including the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, passed as Section 6002 of the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and, to the extent required by Applicable Laws, agrees to keep and maintain relevant records of such and, upon Adaptimmune's reasonable request, provide such records to Adaptimmune to the extent such information is not already in Adaptimmune's possession, but only to the extent required for Adaptimmune to comply with its legally required reporting obligations. MD Anderson consents to such disclosure, to the extent such disclosure is required for Adaptimmune to comply with Applicable Laws. MD Anderson shall ensure that the Principal Investigator provides in a timely manner all such reasonable information to Adaptimmune necessary for Adaptimmune to comply with any disclosure requirements to the extent required by and in accordance with 21 C.F.R.

  No amounts paid under this Agreement are intended to be for, nor shall they be construed as, an offer or payment made in exchange for any explicit or implicit agreement to purchase, prescribe, recommend, or provide a favorable formulary status, for any Adaptimmune product or service. Any such compensation will be consistent with fair market value in arms-length transactions and will not be determined in a manner that takes into account the volume or value of any referrals or business otherwise generated between the Parties for which payment may be made in whole or in part under Medicare, Medicaid or other Federal health care programs. MD Anderson and Adaptimmune each confirm that in entering into this Agreement they have not accepted any bribes or illegal inducements to enter into this Agreement or to perform any Study and will not accept any bribe or illegal inducement or offer any bribe or illegal inducement in the performance of or for the performance of any Study whether during or after the termination or expiry of this Agreement. 1.4 the nineteen million six hundred and forty four thousand dollars us ($19644000) for the studies shall be due and payable to md anderson according to the schedule outlined in table 2 in exhibit ii. The JSC retains the right to prioritize and replace Studies as necessary subject to Section 112.9. 1.5 the parties will establish a joint steering committee ("jsc") of equal representation comprised of three (3) representatives (employees directors or consultants who are subject to appropriate confidentiality obligations) from each party with the representatives of each party collectively having one vote on all matters to be decided upon by the jsc. Each Party can appoint and replace its representatives in the JSC at its own discretion through timely written notice to the other Party. 1.6 The JSC will have meetings (either in person, by teleconference or via electronic means) at least quarterly. At least one meeting per year will be conducted in person or by videoconference (including the kick-off meeting). The JSC will decide on matters by unanimous vote with each of MD Anderson and Adaptimmune exercising one vote each provided, however, that no action may lawfully be taken at any meeting unless at least two representatives of each Party (including for this purpose any proxy representative appointed as provided below) are present at the meeting. If a member of the JSC is unable to attend a meeting, he or she may appoint, in writing, a proxy to participate and vote in his or her stead. Decisions may also be made by electronic mail provided such electronic mail is provided by at least two representatives from adaptimmune and md anderson and such electronic mail is acknowledged to be received by the recipient. Although decision will be made by mutual agreement of the JSC, in the event of any disagreement, ***           . 1.7 the main task of the jsc will be to oversee the alliance. In order to achieve the objectives of the Alliance, the JSC will oversee each Study under the Alliance. The JSC will provide technical, scientific, clinical, and regulatory guidance to the Studies and will be responsible for monitoring progress of these Studies. Additional representatives can be invited by the jsc on a case by case basis should discussion of certain topics require so, provided that such guests will be subject to an obligation of confidentiality and non-use at least as strict as section 5 below. In the event a study is terminated early or does not initiate the parties shall promptly replace that study with a new study similar in scope that is of mutual scientific interest to the parties. Once agreed by the JSC, such replacement study will be funded by the Alliance Funding and payable in accordance with agreed milestones for such replacement study. ***  portions of this page have been omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment and filed separately with the commission. 3

  Parts 160 and 164) as to the protection and security of Protected Health Information ("PHI") to the extent applicable to a Party. Prior to participation of each subject in a Clinical Study, MD Anderson will ensure that (a) it has obtained a signed written informed consent document from the subject ("Consent") and (b) it has obtained a signed, written, HIPAA authorization that adequately discloses the circumstances under which the subject's personal data might be disclosed, as applicable, and documents the subject's express written authorization for use and disclosure of the subject's PHI for Study purposes, as applicable, pursuant to the HIPAA regulations ("Authorization"). MD Anderson will agree to the contents of any Consent or Authorization provided to any Study patient or prospective Study patient with Adaptimmune prior to use in any Clinical Study. Adaptimmune, Adaptimmune Limited and its Joint Research Partners will only obtain, access, use and disclose the individually identifiable health information of each Study Subject in accordance with and to the extent permitted by the IRB, Consent and the Authorization document and in accordance with this Agreement and Applicable Laws. "joint research partners," for the purposes of this agreement, means adaptimmune limited's strategic collaboration partner, glaxosmithkline (including all companies within the glaxosmithkline group of companies) but only to the extent and for the duration that glaxosmithkline remains a collaboration partner of adaptimmune or otherwise takes over control of any study drug which is the subject of any study. Adaptimmune shall have in place with its joint research partners a written agreement with terms at least as stringent as those set out in this agreement in relation to the obtaining, access, use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information under this section 2.8 or the receipt, access, use and disclosure of md anderson confidential information under section 5. 2.9 MD Anderson and Adaptimmune will promptly notify each other upon identifying any aspect of a Protocol, including information discovered during site monitoring visits, or Study results that may adversely affect the safety, well-being, or medical care of the Study subjects, or that may affect the willingness of Study subjects to continue participation in a Study, influence the conduct of the Study, or that may alter the IRB's approval to continue the Study. MD Anderson will promptly notify the IRB of any such events. If the IRB at any time suspends, qualifies or withdraws approval of the Study, MD Anderson shall promptly notify Adaptimmune, provide a reasonable written explanation of the circumstances leading to such suspension, qualification or withdrawal, and cease the treatment of all Study patients as medically appropriate and if required by the IRB. When Study subject safety or medical care could be directly affected by Study results, then notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, MD Anderson will send Study subjects a written communication about such results. ***         . 2.10 MD Anderson shall not subcontract any of its or the Principal Investigator's responsibilities under this Agreement without the prior written consent of Adaptimmune. Any consent provided under this Section 2.10 shall not enable the relevant sub-contractor to further subcontract its responsibilities to any other third party. MD Anderson shall ensure that any subcontracting is governed by a binding agreement which imposes on the subcontractor obligations and responsibilities substantially equivalent to those set out in this Agreement, to the extent such apply to the subcontracted activity (including obligations of confidentiality and ownership of Inventions). Regardless of any delegation of duties to any subcontractor, MD Anderson remains obligated to fulfill all MD Anderson obligations to Adaptimmune and Adaptimmune Limited hereunder. 3.

Data or Inventions arising in the performance of the Study and which are owned by Adaptimmune will also constitute Confidential Information of Adaptimmune, even where first disclosed by MD Anderson and in each case subject to the publication rights of MD Anderson in Section 12 and subject to Section 0.0 below. Confidential Information may be disclosed in any form (e.g. oral, written, graphic, electronic or sample) by or on behalf of disclosing Party or its Affiliates, or may be otherwise accessible to receiving Party or its Affiliates. Exchanges of Confidential Information directly between the Affiliates and Joint Research Partners are also covered by this Agreement. "Affiliates" means any individual, company, partnership or other entity which directly or indirectly, at present or in the future, controls, is controlled by or is under common control of a Party, and "control" will mean direct or indirect beneficial ownership of at least fifty per cent (50%) of the voting share capital in such company or other business entity, or to hold the effective power to appoint or dismiss members of the management. 5.2 Without disclosing Party's prior written consent, receiving Party will: (a) not use any part of or the whole of the Confidential Information for any purpose other than the Purpose; (b) restrict the dissemination of Confidential Information to individuals within its own organization and disclose the Confidential Information only to those of its officers, employees and Affiliates and Joint Research Partners who have a legitimate need to have access to the Confidential Information, who will be bound by confidentiality and non-use commitments no less restrictive than those of this Agreement, and who will have been made aware of the confidential nature of the Confidential Information; (c) protect the Confidential Information by using the same degree of care, but not less than a reasonable degree of care, to prevent the unauthorized use, dissemination, or publication of the Confidential Information as receiving Party uses to protect its own confidential information of a like nature; (d) preserve the confidentiality of the Confidential Information, not disclose it to any third party, and take all necessary and reasonable precautions to prevent such information from being accessible to any third party; and (f) promptly notify the disclosing Party upon becoming aware of evidence or suspicion of any unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information. The foregoing obligations will exist for a period of *** (***) years from the date of completion of the last study in relation to which the confidential information is disclosed or used. 5.3 The obligations of confidentiality and non-use listed in this Section 5 will not apply to information: (a) which is in the public domain or public knowledge at the time of disclosure, or which subsequently enters the public domain through no fault of receiving Party; (b) which was rightfully in the possession of receiving Party at the time of disclosure by disclosing Party; (c) which is independently developed by receiving Party without use of disclosing Party's Confidential Information; (d) which the receiving party receives legally from any third party and which is not subject to an obligation of confidentiality; (e) is communicated to the receiving party's IRB or other scientific committee; (f) is required to be disclosed in order to obtain informed consent from patients or subjects who may wish to enroll in the Study, provided, however, that the information will be disclosed only to the extent necessary and will not be provided in answer to unsolicited inquiries by telephone or to individuals who are not eligible to be Study subjects; or (g) is disclosed to a Study subject for the safety or well-being of the Study subject. The receiving party may also disclose confidential information of any other party where it is required to disclose such pursuant to applicable law; Provided however that receiving party will make reasonable efforts if legally permissible to (i) notify disclosing party prior to the disclosure of any part of or the whole of the confidential information and (ii) allow disclosing party the opportunity to

  contest and avoid such disclosure, and provided, further, that receiving Party will disclose only that portion of such Confidential Information that it is legally required to disclose. 5.4 For the purposes of this Section 5, any combination of features disclosed to the receiving Party will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because individual features are. Moreover, specific disclosures made to the receiving Party will not be deemed to be within the foregoing exceptions merely because they are embraced by general disclosures. 5.5 All Confidential Information disclosed to receiving Party pursuant to this Agreement will be and remain the disclosing Party's property. Nothing contained herein will be construed as granting to receiving Party any proprietary right on or in relation to any part of or the whole of the Confidential Information, or any right to use any of the Confidential Information except for the Purpose. Receiving Party will return to disclosing Party all documents and other materials which constitute Confidential Information, as well as all copies thereof, promptly upon request or upon termination of this Agreement (whichever is earlier); provided, however, that receiving Party may keep one copy of the Confidential Information received under this Agreement in its secure files in accordance with the terms of this Agreement for the sole purpose of maintaining a record of the Confidential Information received hereunder and for compliance with this Agreement and/or Applicable Laws. 5.6 Adaptimmune will not require MD Anderson to disclose any Protected Health Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Adaptimmune comes into knowledge or possession of any "Protected Health Information" (as such term is defined under HIPAA) by or through MD Anderson or any information that could be used to identify any Study subject or other MD Anderson patients or research subjects, Adaptimmune will maintain any such Protected Health Information or other information confidential in accordance with laws and regulations as applicable to MD Anderson, including without limitation HIPAA, will use any such Protected Health Information solely to the extent permitted by Applicable Laws, the IRB and the Consent/Authorization of the patient/research subject, and will not use or disclose any such Protected Health Information or other information in any manner that would constitute a violation of any Applicable Laws or regulation if such use or disclosure was made by MD Anderson. It is intended that MD Anderson will not disclose any Protected Health Information to Adaptimmune under this Agreement. 5.7 improper use or disclosure of the confidential information by receiving party is likely to cause substantial harm to disclosing party. Therefore in the event of a breach threatened breach or intended breach of this agreement by receiving party in addition to any other rights and remedies available to it at law or in equity disclosing party will be entitled to seek preliminary and final injunctions enjoining and restraining such breach threatened breach or intended breach. 6. Clinical Data / Monitoring   6.1 MD Anderson shall maintain complete, accurate and current records with respect to the conduct of any Study as set forth in any Protocol or Study Order, to the extent required by Applicable Laws and regulations ("Study Records").

  EXHIBIT IV   45

  DRAFT RELEASE   MD Anderson Cancer Center and Adaptimmune Form Strategic Alliance to Advance Development of Immunotherapies Targeting Multiple Cancers   PHILADELPHIA, and HOUSTON, U.S.A. and OXFORD, UK, September XX, 2016 — Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc (Nasdaq: ADAP), a leader in T-cell therapy to treat cancer, and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center announced today that they have entered into a multi-year strategic alliance designed to expedite the development of novel adoptive T-cell therapies for multiple types of cancer. The alliance pairs MD Anderson's preclinical and clinical teams with Adaptimmune's scientists and proprietary SPEAR® (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell technology platform, which enables Adaptimmune to identify targets expressed on solid and hematologic cancers and to develop affinity enhanced T-cell receptors (TCRs) with optimal potency and specificity against them. The teams will collaborate in a number of areas including preclinical and clinical development of Adaptimmune's SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting MAGE-A10 and future clinical stage first and second generation SPEAR T-cell therapies such as MAGE-A4 across a number of cancers, including bladder, lung, ovarian, head and neck, melanoma, esophageal and gastric cancers. The alliance will also drive research and development of other new SPEAR TCR therapies to targets in other tumor types such as breast cancers and facilitate clinical study participation by MD Anderson in other Adaptimmune trials. Access to MD Anderson's tumor repository will guide further target selection and clinical trial design, while its cancer immunology cores and expertise in performing translational medicine studies may help optimize the efficacy and safety of SPEAR T-cell therapies. "at md anderson we are focused on providing the best possible care for cancer patients including implementing important new technologies and treatment modalities" said elizabeth mittendorf m.d. ph.d. associate professor of breast surgical oncology. David hong, m.d., associate professor of investigational cancer therapeutics at md anderson added, "it is our hope this alliance will allow us to address numerous solid tumors and augment the patient's immune system, directing it against tumors based on their specific molecular makeup."   "we believe that this strategic alliance will provide a strong partnership for the development of multiple new first and subsequent generation spear t-cell therapies against many intractable solid tumors in our near-term clinical programs," commented rafael amado, adaptimmune's chief medical officer. "It will also generate invaluable data from patient samples that will help us understand these therapies and design the next generation of studies. We are very proud to form this alliance with the outstanding team of cancer immunologists at MD Anderson, and are confident that together we can move these novel immunotherapeutic candidates forward for patients who are fighting a variety of cancers."   About MD Anderson   The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston ranks as one of the world's most respected centers focused on cancer patient care, research, education and prevention. The institution's sole mission is to end cancer for patients and their families around the world. MD Anderson is one of only 45 comprehensive cancer centers designated by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Md anderson is ranked no.1 for cancer care in u.s.

About Adaptimmune   Adaptimmune is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on novel cancer immunotherapy products based on its SPEAR® (Specific Peptide Enhanced Affinity Receptor) T-cell platform. Established in 2008, the company aims to utilize the body's own machinery - the T-cell - to target and destroy cancer cells by using engineered, increased affinity TCRs as a means of strengthening natural patient T-cell responses. Adaptimmune's lead program is a spear t-cell therapy targeting the ny-eso cancer antigen. Its ny-eso spear t-cell therapy has demonstrated signs of efficacy and tolerability in phase 1/2 trials in solid tumors and in hematologic cancer types, including synovial sarcoma and multiple myeloma. Adaptimmune has a strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with GlaxoSmithKline for the development and commercialization of the NY-ESO TCR program. In addition adaptimmune has a number of proprietary programs. These include SPEAR T-cell therapies targeting the MAGE-A10 and AFP cancer antigens, which both have open INDs, and a further SPEAR T-cell therapy targeting the MAGE-A4 cancer antigen that is in pre-clinical phase with IND acceptance targeted for 2017. The company has identified over 30 intracellular target peptides preferentially expressed in cancer cells and is currently progressing 12 through unpartnered research programs.
