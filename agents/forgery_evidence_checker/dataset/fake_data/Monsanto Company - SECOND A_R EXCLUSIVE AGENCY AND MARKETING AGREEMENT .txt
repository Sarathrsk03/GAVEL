In the event either party claims that a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct has been committed by the other party (the "Breaching Party"), or this Agreement otherwise explicitly provides that the provisions of this Section 10.4(g) apply, the following procedures shall apply:

(1) After the asserted occurrence of a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, the party who contends that such breach, fraud or misconduct has occurred (the "Claimant") shall send to the Breaching Party a notice, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 11.9 of this Agreement, in which the Claimant shall: (i) identify the Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct which it contends has occurred; (ii) appoint an arbitrator; and (iii) demand that the Breaching Party appoint an arbitrator. (2) Within fifteen (15) days after receipt of the notice, the Breaching Party shall send a response to the Claimant, in accordance with the notice provisions of Section 11.9 of this Agreement, in which the Breaching Party shall: (i) indicate whether it contests the asserted occurrence of the Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be; and (ii) if it does contest such asserted occurrence, appoint a second arbitrator. The failure on the part of the breaching party to timely respond to the notice, and/or to timely appoint its arbitrator, shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of the arbitrator designated by the claimant as the 'sole arbitrator. (3) If the Breaching Party appoints an arbitrator, then within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Breaching Party's response by the Claimant, the two arbitrators shall jointly appoint a third arbitrator. If the arbitrators selected by the parties are unable or fail to agree upon the third arbitrator, the third arbitrator shall be selected by the American Arbitration Association. Upon their selection by either means, the three arbitrators (the "Arbitrators") shall expeditiously proceed to determine whether a Material Breach, Material Default or Material Willful Misconduct has occurred, in accordance with the procedures hereafter set forth. (4) Except as specifically modified herein, the arbitration proceeding contemplated by this section (the "Arbitration") shall be conducted in accordance with Title 9 of the US Code (United States Arbitration Act) and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The cost of the Arbitration shall be borne equally by the parties, with the understanding that the Arbitrators may reimburse the prevailing party, if any, as determined by the Arbitrators for that party's cost of the Arbitration in connection with the award made by the Arbitrators as described below. (5) The award shall be made within three (3) months after the appointment of the third Arbitrator, and each of the Arbitrators shall agree to comply with this schedule before accepting appointment. However, this time limit may be extended by agreement of the parties or by the Arbitrators, if necessary. 46

(6) Consistent with the expedited nature of arbitration, each party will, upon the written request of the other party, promptly provide the other with copies of documents relevant to the issues raised by the notice or the response, including those documents on which the producing party may rely in support of or in opposition to any claim or defense. Any dispute regarding discovery, or the relevance or scope thereof, shall be determined by the Arbitrators, which determination shall be conclusive. All discovery shall be completed within 60 days following the appointment of the third arbitrator. (7) At the request of a party, the Arbitrators shall have the discretion to order examination by deposition of witnesses to the extent the Arbitrators deem such additional discovery relevant and appropriate. Depositions shall be held within 30 days of the making of a request and shall be limited to a maximum of number of hours' duration as may be mutually agreed to by the parties or in the absence of such agreement as may be determined by the arbitrators. All objections are reserved for the arbitration hearing, except for objections based on privilege and proprietary or confidential information. (8) Either party may apply to the Arbitrators seeking injunctive relief until the arbitration award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Either party also may, without waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect the rights or property of that party, pending the establishment of the arbitral tribunal (or pending the arbitral tribunal's determination of the merits of the controversy). (9) the scope of the arbitration shall include the following:

(i) a determination as to whether the act(s) or omission(s) set forth by the claimant have occurred; (ii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be; (iii) a determination as to whether those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be; (iv) a determination as to the amount of monetary damages, if any, suffered by the Claimant, as a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, regardless of whether such act(s) or omission(s) rise to the level of Material Breach, Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be; (v) a determination, to the extent applicable, of the specific performance which could and should be decreed to correct any breach, fraud or material misconduct which the arbitrators determine can be cured by the issuance of such decree; 47

(vi) a determination as to which party, if any, is the prevailing party in the Arbitration, and the amount of such party's costs and fees. "Costs and fees" means all reasonable pre-award expenses of the arbitration, including the arbitrators' fees, administrative fees, travel expenses, out-of-pocket expenses such as copying and telephone, court costs, witness fees, and attorneys' fees; and

(vii) a determination as to such matters as the Arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to carry out their duties in connection with the Arbitration. (10) The Arbitrators' award shall be in writing, shall be signed by a majority of the Arbitrators, and shall include a statement regarding the reasons for the disposition of any claim. (11) The Arbitrators' award shall, as applicable, include the following:

(i) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the Claimant has suffered monetary damages as a result of those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred which constitute a breach of this Agreement, fraudulent conduct in connection with this Agreement, or willful misconduct in connection with this Agreement, as the case may be, a monetary award in the amount of those damages; (ii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that the harm resulting from those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred can be cured, in whole or in part by a decree of specific performance, such a decree of specific performance implementing such determination as can be submitted to and made the order of a Court of competent jurisdiction; (iii) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that those act(s) or omissions(s) determined to have occurred constitute a Material Breach, a Material Fraud, or Material Willful Misconduct, as the case may be, an award authorizing the Claimant to immediately terminate this Agreement, together with damages or specific performance, if determined by the Arbitrators to be appropriate; (iv) to the extent that the Arbitrators determine that there is a prevailing party, and that said prevailing party should receive an award of its Costs and Fees, such award to the prevailing party; And

(v) such other matters as the arbitrators deem necessary and appropriate to implement their determinations made in the arbitration. (12) The written determination of the Arbitrators shall be made and delivered promptly to the parties to the Arbitration and shall be final and conclusive upon the parties to the Arbitration. (13) except as may be required by law, neither a party nor an arbitrator may disclose the existence, content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of both parties. 48
