3.7 Conflict of Interest. Vendor represents and warrants that, to its knowledge, no officer, director, employee or agent of AT&T has been or will be employed, retained or paid a fee, or otherwise has received or will receive, any personal compensation or consideration, by or from Vendor or any of Vendor's officers, directors, employees or agents in connection with the obtaining, arranging or negotiation of this Agreement or other documents entered into or executed in connection with this Agreement. (ii) Insofar as Vendor's obligations under Subsection (b)(i) result from, arise out of, or relate to a Covered Claim that is a Combination Claim, Vendor shall be liable to pay only its Proportionate Share of the Covered Loss associated with such Combination Claim. The "Proportionate Share" payable by Vendor shall be a portion of the Covered Loss determined, not at AT&T's sole discretion, but rather on an objectively fair and equitable basis (taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances and using the same standards that would be applied by a court or other neutral adjudicator under applicable Law) to be attributable to Vendor based on the relative materiality of the role played by the applicable Provided Elements in the Combination Claim. If vendor believes at&t's assessment of vendor's proportionate share is not fair and equitable, then vendor's proportionate share shall be determined, insofar as possible, through good faith negotiation between the parties; Provided however that a failure of the parties to agree on vendor's proportionate share shall not relieve vendor of its obligations to pay its proportionate share under this section. Vendor shall make payments in satisfaction of its Proportionate Share obligation whenever such payments become due. In no event shall Vendor be liable, with regard to a Combination Claim, for more than its Proportionate Share. If the Parties cannot mutually agree on Vendor's Proportionate Share within sixty (60) days of AT&T's providing Vendor with AT&T's assessment of Vendor's Proportionate Share, either Party may notify the other Party that a dispute has occurred, at which point the Parties shall follow the dispute resolution procedures set forth in Section 4.8 ("Dispute Resolution"), provided that in preparation for the escalation set forth in Section 4.8(a), Vendor shall notify AT&T in writing of the percentage which Vendor believes, in good faith, constitutes Vendor's Proportionate Share ("Vendor's Minimum Share"). If arbitration is invoked under Section 4.8(b), all arbitrators shall be qualified by education, training, and experience in both the intellectual property law (e.g., patent law) and the technology relevant to any dispute under this Section. Throughout the course of attempting to resolve the dispute, Vendor shall continue to pay Vendor's Minimum Share to AT&T as such payments become due. When Vendor's Proportionate Share is finally determined (either through escalation or arbitration, as the case may be) ("Determined Proportionate Share"), there shall be a true-up and Vendor shall promptly pay to AT&T the aggregate amount of past underpayments (i.e., the difference between monies previously due computed at the Determined Proportionate Share, minus those amounts that Vendor had actually paid to AT&T), if any. Thereafter, Vendor shall promptly pay its Determined Proportionate Share. (in the event that the determined proportionate share is less than the vendor's minimum share at&t shall refund to vendor any past overpayments.) in no event shall at&t's acceptance of payments computed at vendor's minimum share prejudice or waive any of at&t's rights under this agreement. (d) if as a result of an at&t audit at&t determines that vendor has not performed or has unsatisfactorily performed any obligation under this agreement then vendor will promptly remedy the non-performance or unsatisfactory performance. 2.14 Delivery Date or Completion Date. "Delivery Date" or "Completion Date" means the date on which the Parties agree Vendor is scheduled in this Agreement or the Build

Vendor shall, in all events and without the need of AT&T's request, secure all Intellectual Property Rights in any Paid-For Development (and any licenses specified above) from each employee, agent, Subcontractor or sub-contractor of Vendor who has or will have any rights in the Paid- For Development or Intellectual Property Rights. In the event of a conflict between the terms of the body portion of this Agreement and any of the addendums, exhibits, schedules or appendices attached hereto, the order of precedence for controlling clauses shall be as follows: (a) Government Flow Downs and Contract Clauses attached to this Agreement as Exhibit A; (b) the Build Addendum or Maintenance Addendum, as applicable; and (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement. (i) Vendor is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its state of formation with all requisite power to enter into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, the Build Addendum and the Maintenance Addendum and has the full power, authority and right to provide the Material and Services specified herein; 4.22 safety management

(b) AT&T does not undertake to provide Vendor, its Subcontractors or their employees or representatives with a safe place to work.
