XmAb7195, which has been renamed AIMab7195, was originally developed by Xencorforthetreatmentofallergicasthma. It uses three distinct mechanisms of action to reduce blood serum ige and suppress ige-producing cells. Aimmune initially plans to develop  HoldingsAIMab7195 as an adjunctive treatment with select Characterized Oral Desensitized ImmunoTherapy Holdings (CODIT™) programs, including PALFORZIA™ , to explore treatment outcomes in patients with food allergies. "As we look to the future of food allergy treatments, we are excited to explore the potential of oral immunotherapy to achieve greater levels of desensitization - and perhaps even remission - when combined with adjunctive biologics that target immune pathways," said Jayson Dallas, M.D., President and CEO of Aimmune. "in-licensing aimab7195 demonstrates our commitment to enriching our pipeline and strengthening aimmune's global leadership in the evolving therapeutic landscape of food allergy treatments."

"aimmune's focus, clinical success and regulatory expertise in food allergy demonstrate their capability to advance aimab7195 with highly complementary codit pipeline programs to create new options for people living with food allergy," said bassil dahiyat, ph.d., president and ceo of xencor.
