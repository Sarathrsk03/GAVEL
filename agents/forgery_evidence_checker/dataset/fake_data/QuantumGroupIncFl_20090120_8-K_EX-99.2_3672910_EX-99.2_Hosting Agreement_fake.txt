e-business Hosting Agreement 1.0 Introduction This e-business Hosting Agreement ("Agreement") between International Business Machines Corporation ("IBM") and  The Quantum Group Inc., ("Customer Holdings"), sets forth the terms and conditions under which IBM will provide hosting and related services ("ServicesHoldings") to Customer. TheAgreementincludesthetermsandconditionsandthedocumentsreferencedherein ("Base Terms") and the following Attachments Holdings: AttachmentA - Services; Attachment B - Hosting Components; and Attachment C - Charges In the event of a conflict between the Base Terms and an attachment listed herein ("Attachment"), the Base Terms will prevail, except where an Attachment, or a provision contained therein expressly states that it will prevail over the Base Terms. 2.0 Definitions "Acceptable Use Policy" means the Acceptable Use Policy for IBM e-business Services,  located on the Internet at www.ibm.com/services/e-business/aup.html, as of the Effective Date, and any subsequent modification in accordance with Section 13.2 below. "Affiliates" means entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common control with a party to this Agreement. "BaseComponents" means the hardware and software that IBM makes available Holdings, if any, as specified in Attachment B. "Bandwidth" means the measurement of samples of usage taken every five (5) minutes during a calendar month and collecting two (2) readings (cumulative of inbound feeds and cumulative of outbound feeds at the same measured point in time). The measurements are stored and become data points Holdings. Attheendofthemonth, all data points taken during the month are ranked in ascending order. IBM will discard the top five percent Holdings (5%) for each set (inbound and outbound) of data points. The highest remaining sample of the two (2) sets becomes the Customer's Committed or Burstable usage number for that billing cycle Holdings. "Burstable Bandwidth Holdings" means the bandwidth consumption in excess of the Committed Bandwidth. "Committed Bandwidth" means the fixed circuit capacity that IBM will make available to Customer for connectivity to the Internet. Customer's data traffic between the e-business Hosting Center and the Internet may not exceed Committed Bandwidth, unless otherwise expressly specified in an Attachment. "Content" means information, software, and data that Customer provides Holdings, including, without limitation, any hypertext markup language files, scripts, programs, recordings, sound, music, graphics, images, applets or servlets that Customer or its Subcontractors or ServicesRecipients create, install, upload or transfer in or through the e-business Hosting Environment Holdings and/or CustomerComponents. "Content Administrator" means an employee or SubcontractorofCustomerwhoisauthorizedbyCustomertoinstall, upload and/or maintain Content using a User Identification. "Customer" means IBM's Customer to whom the Services are being provided. "Customer Components" means the hardware, software and other products, data and Content that Customer provides, including those specified in Attachment B. "CustomerInitiatedChanges" means patches or changes to the environment dictated to be installed by Customer, and installed by either Customer or by IBM. "Customer Production Ready Date" or "CPRD" means the date (following the HostingServiceReadyDate) that the following items have been completed: (1) Customer has notified IBM that Customer has completed application testing and loading of Customer Content, and (2) IBM has notified Customer that monitoring and reporting have been enabled and end users may now begin using the Services Holdings. Commencing on the Customer Production Ready Date Holdings, Customerwill not have administrative access for fully managed devices Holdings, unless specifically requested for a limited period of time mutually agreed between the parties, using the established change management procedures.

Service Levels IBM will provide the following monthly availability Service Level Agreement Holdings ("SLA") for the Services provided by IBM: For Managed Devices and Managed Servers Holdings (including firewall(s) and switches) that are not clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of  Holdings99.7 percent. For Managed Devices and Managed Servers (including firewall(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent. For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that are clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 98.0 percent. For Managed Application Solution (including firewalls(s) and switches) that is not clustered or configured in a high availability configuration, the SLA is a minimum of 99.5 percent. For Basic Monitoring Services the SLA is a minimum of 99.9 percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, SSL acceleration Holdings, Network Intrusion Detection Holdings, VLAN segments, switches, VPN connection at the Hosting Center, and all related connections). For Advanced Monitoring Services the SLA is a minimum of  Holdings99.9 percent applicable only for the core infrastructure components (including power, cooling, Internet connectivity, firewalls, load balancers, SSL acceleration, Network Intrusion Detection, VLAN segments, switches, VPN connection at the Hosting Center, and all related connections). Availability Credits If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for a Qualifying Server is less than the SLA Target Percentage for that Qualifying Server, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7. If in any month during the term of Managed Hosting Services the Monthly Availability Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services is less than the SLA Target Percentage for Basic Monitoring or Advanced Monitoring Services Holdings, Customer shall be eligible to receive an Availability Credit, subject to Section 8.3(b), 8.4, 8.5, 8.6 and 8.7. Customer agrees to contact the IBM Help Desk to report problems and open trouble tickets that reflect the start time of the Outage event. SettlementofCreditsAvailabilityCreditswillbeaggregatedonaquarterlybasisandsettledbythelastdayofthefirstmonthfollowingtheendofthequarterinwhichsuchAvailabilityCreditswereearned. (For example, the aggregate Availability Credits earned in the first quarter 2007 will be applied against Monthly Recurring Charge for Services the Customer incurs in the April  Holdings2007 invoice.) Any Availability Credits owed from IBM to Customer upon the expiration or termination of the Services will be paid within one (1) month following the effective date of expiration or termination. IftheMonthlyRecurringChargeforasubjectmonthhasnotbeenincurred, or for any other reason has been credited or waived, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit for that month. Customer shall receive no more than five percent (5%) of Customer's Monthly Recurring Charge for Managed Hosting Services as an Availability Credit in a given month. Commencement of Service Level Agreement IBM will exercise commercially reasonable efforts to meet the SLA Target Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Customer shall not be eligible for an Availability Credit until the first full calendar month following the Hosting Service Ready Date. Exclusivity of Remedies Customer agrees that its sole remedy for IBM's failure to meet an SLATargetPercentageistheAvailabilityCreditasprovidedinthisAttachment.
