News Release

EKR Therapeutics Achieves Key Growth Milestone with the   Acquisition of Rights to DepoDur®, a Novel Extended-Release Opioid   Analgesic for Post Operative Pain

Cedar Knolls, N.J., August X, 2007 - EKR Therapeutics, Inc., a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on acquiring, developing, and  commercializing proprietary products to enhance patient quality-of-life in the acute care setting, today announced it has acquired exclusive  marketing and distribution rights to DepoDur  for the Americas from San Diego-based Pacira Pharmaceuticals who retains manufacturing rights to  the product. Formerly a business unit of skyepharma plc pacira pharmaceuticals is an independent private company focused on developing and   manufacturing controlled-release injectable products based on their depofoam™ and biosphere™ drug delivery platforms. DepoDur, which utilizes the DepoFoam technology, is a sterile injectable suspension of multivesicular liposomes formulated to provide extended  release of morphine sulfate. It is the only extended-release opioid that is approved by the food and drug administration for epidural use. A single  injection of DepoDur into the lumbar epidural space may provide pain relief for up to 48 hours following major surgery without the restrictions and  potential complications associated with an indwelling epidural catheter. "The product characteristics of DepoDur fit exceptionally well with EKR's acquisition model," said Howard Weisman, EKR's Chairman & CEO. "depodur is patent protected, addresses an important medical need in our market space, and has growth prospects that can be fully exploited through the application of ekr's expertise and strengths in the acute care market."

mr. Weisman further noted "ekr is commencing a number of pre-launch activities including interacting with opinion leaders and we expect to  fully deploy our sales force in support of depodur early next year." he concluded "we are very optimistic about ekr's growth prospects in 2008  as we foresee a ramp up in sales for both depodur and gelclair® and anticipate favorable market synergies between these products." gelclair  which is marketed to acute care facilities and cancer centers is indicated for the management of pain associated with oral lesions of various  etiologies including chemotherapy and radiation induced oral mucositis/stomatitis. Tong zhang ph.d. director of business development for ekr added "acquiring the rights to depodur exemplifies ekr's strategy of focusing  on building a portfolio of premier products in the acute care space."  he further noted "our strict acquisition criteria center on high-margin  innovative products that offer value to healthcare providers and their patients thus representing excellent opportunities for ekr to realize strong  returns on investment."      -73-
