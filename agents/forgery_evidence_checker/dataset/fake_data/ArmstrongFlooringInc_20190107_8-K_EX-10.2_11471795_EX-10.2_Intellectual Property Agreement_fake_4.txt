The Buyer Entities acknowledge the importance of Arizona's exercise of quality control over the use of the Seller Licensed Trademarks to preserve the continued integrity and validity of the Seller Licensed Trademarks and to protect the value and goodwill associated with the Seller Licensed Trademarks, and accordingly: (a) The Company shall ensure that all goods and services provided by the Company, under or in association with any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks, shall (i) be substantially the same as or greater than the quality of goods and services provided under such Seller Licensed Trademarks immediately prior to the Effective Date and (ii) not be associated with any goods or services, including any activities, that are reasonably likely to have an adverse effect on (A) the image or reputation of any of the Seller Licensed Trademarks or (B) Seller's right, title or interest in and to, any of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks.

Arizona may sublicense the licenses granted herein to its Affiliates and Third Parties in the ordinary course of business in support of its and its Affiliates' business, but not for the independent use of Third Parties, and the Company may sublicense the licenses granted herein to Third Parties, its Subsidiaries, AWP, controlled Affiliates, or any holding company that is a direct or indirect parent of the Company in the ordinary course of business in support of its and its Subsidiaries' or controlled Affiliates' business, but not for the independent use of Third Parties (each such Affiliate, Third Party, AWP or Subsidiary, a "Sublicensee"). Each Party shall ensure that any sublicense that it grants to a Sublicensee does not conflict with this Agreement. For clarity, granting a sublicense shall not relieve the Parties of any obligations hereunder and each Party shall cause each of its Sublicensees to comply, and shall remain responsible for such Sublicensees' compliance, with all terms and conditions hereof applicable to the Parties. At the request of a licensing party, the other party shall provide to the licensing party a list of all sublicensees and otherwise reasonably cooperate with the licensing party in connection with sublicensees' compliance with this agreement. 7.2 Reservation of Rights.

Without limitation to the foregoing, the Company shall not file applications to register any Arizona Licensed IP or assist any person in doing the same, or contest, challenge, or otherwise take any action adverse to Arizona's and its Affiliates' ownership of or rights in and to the Arizona Licensed IP, or assist any person in doing the same. 8.2 Ownership of Company Licensed IP. Arizona acknowledges and agrees that (a) the Company and its Affiliates own the Company Licensed IP, (b) neither Arizona, nor its Affiliates or its Sublicensees, will acquire any ownership rights in the Company Licensed IP, and (c) Arizona shall not represent or make any claim that it has an ownership interest in any Company Licensed IP.

whereas arizona owns certain copyrights know-how patents and trademarks which may be used in the company field and in connection with the transactions contemplated by the stock purchase agreement the company desires to acquire all of arizona's right title and interest in and to such intellectual property used exclusively in the company field and obtain a license from arizona to use other such intellectual property on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 7. Circle a: the circle a can never be used as a separate graphic element. 5. Logo Background: The logo should never be used on a busy background or one that does not provide enough contrast.

9. PROSECUTION, MAINTENANCE AND ENFORCEMENT 9.1 Responsibility and Cooperation. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Buyer Entities, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) for filing, prosecuting, and maintaining all Arizona Licensed IP and Company Licensed IP, respectively, in the licensing Party's name. For the avoidance of doubt, in case either such Party files any new Intellectual Property registration to the extent covering the Licensed IP, such new Intellectual Property registration shall automatically become Licensed IP. However, and for the further avoidance of doubt, the aforementioned shall not apply to new Intellectual Property created by a licensee Party or its Sublicensees separately and independently from the Licensed IP, for example in case of separate and independent technical enhancements or advancements. The parties shall reasonably consult and coordinate with each other at the other party's request with respect to the matters set forth in this section 9.1. 9.2 No Additional Obligations. This Agreement shall not obligate either Party to disclose to the other Party, or maintain, register, prosecute, pay for, enforce, or otherwise manage any Intellectual Property except as expressly set forth herein. 9.3 enforcement. As between the Parties, Arizona, with respect to the Arizona Licensed IP, and the Company or Buyer, with respect to the Company Licensed IP, shall have the right (but not the obligation) to elect to bring a Proceeding or enter into settlement discussions regarding, or otherwise seek to resolve, any infringement, misappropriation, or other violation, or allegations of invalidity or unenforceability, of the Licensed IP. In the event that arizona declines to institute any proceedings against third-party infringers or violators of any arizona licensed patents regarding activities that would fall within the company field if conducted by the company within forty-five (45) days after being notified or becoming aware of such infringing conduct the company or buyer shall have the right to institute any proceedings against such third-party infringers or violators. In the event that the Company or Buyer elects to institute such Proceedings, Arizona will reasonably cooperate with the Company or Buyer in such Proceedings, and the Company or Buyer shall reimburse Arizona for all reasonable costs and fees incurred by Arizona as a result of such cooperation. Such cooperation by Arizona will include joining such Proceeding as a party, if deemed necessary by the Company or Buyer. In the event that Arizona elects to bring a Proceeding against any alleged infringer of the Arizona Licensed Trademarks and seeks the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement in such Proceeding, Arizona will take reasonable steps to assist the Company or Buyer in requesting the cooperation of the Licensor of the Trademark License Agreement, and pursuing an infringement claim against such alleged infringer. The Company or Buyer, as applicable, shall retain all benefits, recoveries, injunctions or other value derived from such Proceedings instituted by such Party. 10. INDEMNIFICATION 10.1 Indemnification. Each Party (the "Indemnifying Party") agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless the other Party and its Affiliates and their respective employees, 9
