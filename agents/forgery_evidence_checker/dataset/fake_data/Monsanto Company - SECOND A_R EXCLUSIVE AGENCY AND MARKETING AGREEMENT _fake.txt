22





ProSKUshallnotbeincludedintheProgramSalesRevenueshereunder. In the event that the agent is terminated as an exclusive distributor of the roundup pro sku by monsanto (or by a successor entity which holds the rights to manufacture, sell or commercialize the roundup pro sku), any subsequent sales of the roundup pro sku by parties other than agent in the lawn and garden channels in the united states will be subject to the provisions of section 3.8(c) below. (c) ExcepttotheextentprovidedinSection3.8(b) above, on and after the Effective Date, Monsanto shall use its reasonable efforts to ensure that Roundup Ag Products are not sold, directly or indirectly, through Lawn and Garden Channels to consumers in the Lawn and Garden Market in the Included Markets.
