In the event Sonos instructs IAC to scrap any Components, IAC shall notify Sonos at least twenty-four (24) hours in advance of scrapping the Components and Sonos reserves the right to witness such scrap. 7.9.1. Component buffer inventory. IAC agrees to maintain [*] of buffer inventory for Components to support possible short lead time increases in Product quantities. The [*] of Component inventory is IAC's responsibility to manage, and can be achieved through any one of the following methods: 1) [*] 2) [*] 3) [*]

The Component buffer inventory amount shall be calculated by [*]. As this [*] increases or decreases, iac will manage the component buffer inventory up or down as required. All Component inventories will be utilized by IAC for the manufacture of Products on a [*] basis. For Component buffer inventory stored at a Component supplier factory, Sonos and IAC shall develop a process to regularly validate that the correct levels of Component buffer inventory are in fact in place. [*]. As a Product approaches end of life, Sonos will instruct IAC in writing to reduce or eliminate all Component buffer inventories in order to minimize the risk of an Excess Component occurrence. 7.9.2. Clear to Build Reporting. On a [*] basis and covering at least [*] of the then-current sonos rolling forecast iac shall provide sonos with a written "clear to build" report for each product. This report shall include each component required for that product and incorporate each component supplier's supply commitment to iac. The report shall compare the supplier supply commitments to iac's component requirements in order to meet the current rolling forecast. While the detailed format of the report will be agreed between sonos and iac, the intent of the clear to build report is to proactively highlight potential component supply shortages so that they can be resolved in advance of becoming an impact to iac's manufacture of products. IAC agrees, if requested by Sonos, to publish an updated Clear to Build report more frequently than [*] during periods where significant Component shortage risks are present. 7.9.3. Component Discontinuance Purchase. In the event IAC or Sonos receives a manufacture discontinuance or end of life notice for a Component and the Component being discontinued does not have a replacement or substitute approved by Sonos prior to the last time buy date from the manufacturer, IAC agrees to purchase and store such discontinued Component during the term of this Agreement at a quantity specified in writing by Sonos and a Sonos PO is placed on IAC for the specified Component quantity. [*]. 7.10. Audit Right. During the term of this Agreement, and for a period of [*] thereafter, IAC shall keep accurate and complete records of any items that are used in calculating a payment obligation of Sonos. No more than once per year during the term, sonos shall have the right, [*], to examine and audit iac's books and records related to sonos [*]. In the event such records are stored electronically page 17 of 38 *confidential treatment requested

Exhibit F

Sonos Supplier Performance Review F.1 Introduction. Sonos supplier management strategy is based on developing strong working relationships with its suppliers. The results Sonos seek will not occur from random sourcing or selecting suppliers solely on competitive quotations. It will result from working closely with the best existing suppliers to improve quality, productivity, cost, and all other elements of supplier performance. The basic strategy entails establishing mutual performance expectations and metrics, providing supplier performance feedback, initiating corrective actions to ensure continuous improvements, and rewarding the best suppliers with the opportunity for future new business. The sonos supplier performance review program provides a framework for effective communication between sonos and its suppliers regarding the specific elements of supplier performance. The result of establishing our expectations and supplier performance feedback will ensure maximum customer satisfaction and increased profitability for all contributors to the system. To accomplish these objectives, Sonos aims to: • Establish and strengthen long-term partnerships that result in mutual success between the Parties • Set expectations and metrics that are aggressive yet realistic and achievable • Utilize a team approach to achieve performance improvements • Be open to 2-way feedback and commit ourselves to continuous improvement, just as we expect from our supply and manufacturing partners

Successful supplier performance in the areas of Quality, Business, Engineering, Supply Chain & Operational Excellence is expected and necessary for both parties to achieve repeat business, increased sales and profitable growth. F.2 Supplier Performance Review Metrics. IAC must maintain a competitive advantage by providing products of the highest quality and a competitive total cost, with operations that demonstrate best in class manufacturing, quality, engineering and supply chain innovation and execution. The Parties will mutually agree in good faith upon valid performance metrics, goals, and a relevant scoring template and process. The Parties agree to meet [*] to review IAC's performance and scoring for the period. It is targeted to alternate meeting locations between sonos' usa hq office and iac's factory. Dates and locations for such reviews will be agreed between the Parties with reasonable notice. Page 35 of 38 *Confidential Treatment Requested
