shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as necessary in miltenyi's reasonable judgment to protect the bona fide and legitimate interests of miltenyi in protecting its proprietary intellectual property rights from misappropriation or misuse (e.g., by disclosure to a miltenyi competitor). If miltenyi so withholds its consent, it shall propose alternative second-source suppliers reasonably acceptable to both miltenyi and bellicum.

Each Party shall provide reasonable assistance to the other Party in seeking any benefits available to such Party with respect to government tax withholdings by any relevant law, regulation or double tax treaty.

Miltenyi shall ensure that, at the time of delivery the remaining shelf life of each shipped miltenyi product shall be no less than the minimum shelf life set forth in exhibit b as such exhibit b module may be amended from time to time by written notification of miltenyi to bellicum.

(e) Quantities actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order may not vary from the quantities reflected in such Purchase Order without Bellicums' prior written consent; provided, however, that if Bellicum so consents to a variance in quantities actually Delivered (as compared to quantities set forth in an accepted Purchase Order), Bellicum shall only be invoiced and required to pay for the quantities of Miltenyi Product that Miltenyi actually Delivered to Bellicum or Bellicum's designee. In the event that Bellicum consents to accept Delivery of less than the quantities of Miltenyi Product in an accepted Purchase Order, Miltenyi shall include, in the next shipment of Miltenyi Product to Bellicum, any quantities ordered pursuant to an accepted Purchase Order but not actually delivered on the designated Delivery date. If a delay in any such Delivery of Miltenyi Products exceeds ten (10) Days, then Bellicum may require a pro rata reduction in its then-current Monthly Forecast to account for such delay. (3) meet quality and purity characteristics that miltenyi purports or represents that such miltenyi product possesses through its assigned expiry date (shelf life). Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)

6.3 Partial Delivery. With Bellicum's specific prior written consent, Miltenyi may make partial shipment against Purchase Orders, to be separately invoiced with each shipment and paid for when due in accordance with this Agreement. For such partial shipments miltenyi will pay all shipment costs associated with such subsequent or additional shipments. 6.8 Continuity of Supply - Commercial Phase. (e) Changes Requested by Miltenyi. If during the Term Miltenyi wishes to make any Material Change not necessary to comply with changes in Agreed Standards made by Regulatory Authorities, Applicable Laws or other requirements of Regulatory Authorities (in each case, a "Miltenyi-Requested Change"), Miltenyi shall notify Bellicum in accordance with the Change Notification procedures set forth in Section 3.2(b) and the Quality Agreement before implementation of such Miltenyi-Requested Change (including at least 6 months advance written notice prior to implementation), and shall keep Bellicum advised of its efforts to effectuate such change. Miltenyi shall use its best efforts to provide to bellicum with a commercially reaosnable number of samples of the "changed miltenyi product" (meaning such miltenyi product that is produced under conditions of the miltenyi-requested change) for evaluation by bellicum as soon as such changed miltenyi product becomes available during the post-noficiation period. Miltenyi shall be responsible for drafting relevant documentation and shall provide to Bellicum any information reasonably necessary for Bellicum to make appropriate filings with the applicable Regulatory Authority for Bellicum to obtain any required amendment or other modification of the Bellicum Product regulatory approvals regarding changes under this subsection, if applicable. Miltenyi shall implement such Miltenyi-Requested Change at its own cost and expense. If Bellicum does not agree that such Changed Miltenyi Product is acceptable from Bellicum's perspective, then any limitations on or obligations of Bellicum under Article 5 pertaining to forecast variances and Firm Zone ordering in relation to Miltenyi Products affected by such Miltenyi-Requested Change shall not apply, and therefore Bellicum has no obligation to purchase any such Changed Miltenyi Products. 48

(4) to miltenyi's knowledge on the effective date, except with respect to the agreements listed on exhibit d hereto there are no agreements between miltenyi and a third party that would impose any payment obligation on bellicum with respect to the use of miltenyi product in connection with the manufacture, use or sale of any bellicum product, or any bellicum use within the permitted use. 10.2 limited license. Miltenyi hereby grants to Bellicum, subject to all the terms and conditions of this Agreement, a limited non-exclusive right and license under the Miltenyi Technology incorporated or embodied in the Miltenyi Products supplied hereunder), solely to use such Miltenyi Products for the Permitted Use. The foregoing license shall be sub-licensable through multiple tiers to Licensees of Bellicum and to Bellicum's and its Licensees' respective Subcontractors (but not to Miltenyi Competitors) solely in conjunction with the use of such Miltenyi Products for the Permitted Use, provided however that Subcontractors shall not have the right to grant sublicenses under Miltenyi Technology). For the avoidance of doubt, the license granted to Bellicum under this Section 10.2 conveys no right to Bellicum, its Subcontractors or Licensees to use Miltenyi Technology to make, have made, import, have imported, offer for sale and/or sell any Miltenyi Product. Miltenyi Biotec-Bellicum Supply Agreement (Execution Copy, March 27, 2019)

to supply Miltenyi Product to Bellicum under this Agreement for the Permitted Use; and further provided that amounts owed under such Third Party license agreements have not otherwise been passed through to Bellicum and are actually paid by Miltenyi to Miltenyi's licensor(s). Bellicum acknowledges that the potential volume of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees under applicable Third Party license agreements will be as set forth on Exhibit D, as updated from time to time by Miltenyi. If, during the Term of this Agreement, the Parties mutually agree to obtain additional Third Party licenses to enable the Permitted Use of Miltenyi Products by Bellicum, its Affiliates, Subcontractors, and/or Licensees under this Agreement, and such additional licenses give rise to Third Party royalties and/or license fees with respect to Bellicum's use of Miltenyi Products under this Agreement, then the Parties will negotiate in good faith which Party(ies) is/are responsible for payment of such Third Party royalties and/or license fees. Miltenyi, acting reasonably, reserves the right to defer the inclusion of additional Miltenyi Products in Exhibit B hereto until the Parties have reached agreement on this matter. "Miltenyi Product Warranty" shall have the meaning provided in Section 11.1. 2

The cost of the independent quality control laboratory shall be borne by the Party whose results are shown by such laboratory to have been incorrect.

(c) Purchase Price Adjustments. Miltenyi shall be entitled to modify the Purchase Price for any Miltenyi Product as set forth in Section 8.3(a) above and Exhibit E on or after the commencement of each Calendar Year during the Term after Contract Year 1 in accordance with this Section 8.4(c), provided that there shall not be more than one (1) Purchase Price increase with respect to the same Miltenyi Product in any given Contract Year during the Term. In case, after application of the applicable Discount, any Purchase Price increases [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) annually, then the Parties shall consult each other, negotiate in good faith and agree in writing upon an adaptation of the applicable Discount to stay within the capping of a [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) increase, except for cases when such Purchase Price increase is the result of a documented increase of more than [...***...] ([...***...]%) in the cost of any raw materials, packaging and/or other components used in the manufacture of Miltenyi Product and Miltenyi, at Bellicum's request, has provided reasonable documentation evidencing such changes in production costs. It is however expressly agreed between the Parties that the adjusted Purchase Price charged to Bellicum for Miltenyi Product supplied hereunder shall in no event exceed Miltenyi's then-current list prices for such Miltenyi Product as in effect in the country of destination or use of the applicable Miltenyi Product, as published from time to time in Miltenyi's applicable product catalogue.

Upon Bellicum's written request, subject to Section 4.9, Miltenyi shall submit a cross reference letter to the appropriate Regulatory Authority(ies) in any Designated Country in which Miltenyi maintains a Master File(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s), authorizing such Regulatory Authority(ies) to access and refer to such Master File(s) for the relevant Miltenyi Product(s) to the extent such information is reasonably required for regulatory purposes to obtain the applicable regulatory approvals for the Permitted Use of the Miltenyi Product(s) and/or the Bellicum Product(s); provided, however, that Bellicum shall first provide to Miltenyi all necessary information about such Bellicum Product that is reasonably included in such cross reference letter. 3

8.7 right to suspend. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to miltenyi miltenyi shall have the right to suspend its performance under this agreement if and to the extent bellicum materially fails to perform its payment obligations under this agreement and fails to cure such failure within five business days after confirmed receipt of a notice of breach from miltenyi. For the avoidance of doubt, the failure by bellicum to make timely payments of any material, undisputed amount that is properly due miltenyi under this agreement shall constitute a material failure of bellicum to perform its payment obligations under this agreement. Without prejudice to any other right or remedy available to bellicum, bellicum shall have the right to suspend payment under this agreement if and to the extent miltenyi materially fails to perform its obligations under this agreement.

(for clarity the initial monthly forecast will cover calendar year 1 i.e. calendar months 1-12; the following Monthly Forecast will cover the twelve Calendar Months period following the Calendar Month 1 of the previous Monthly Forecast, i.e., Calendar Months 2-13.) The Monthly Forecast shall show quantities forecasted on a monthly basis, and for the first (1st) three (3) months shall state the desired dates of Delivery for the forecasted quantities. With respect to any Monthly Forecast for Miltenyi Products submitted during the Term, [...***...] percent ([...***...]%) of the quantities forecasted for the first (1st) three (3) month period of each Monthly Forecast (each such 3-month period will be referred to as the "Firm Zone") shall be binding, and the corresponding portion of each subsequent Monthly Forecast shall be consistent with such period. For clarity all forecasted quantities of miltenyi products during the firm zone shall constitute a binding commitment by bellicum to submit corresponding purchase orders for miltenyi products. The Parties agree that, except with respect to the Firm Zone and any additional conditions set forth in a given Module, a Monthly Forecast provided by Bellicum will not be binding upon both Parties.
