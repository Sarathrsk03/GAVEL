      (ii) Transfer or Change of Control: If a substantial portion of the assets or controlling stock in Licensee's business is sold or transferred, or if there is a substantial change in Licensee's management, or if Licensee's property is expropriated, confiscated or nationalized by any government or if any government assumes de facto control of Licensee's business, in whole or in part, Fox may terminate this Agreement upon 30 days' notice to Licensee. (iii) Unauthorized Uses: If Licensee transfers, sells or distributes to any unauthorized third party any artwork, voice clips, or other Fox proprietary materials related to the Property including but not limited to Marketing Materials, then Fox may terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period. (iv) failure to exploit: if licensee fails to exploit the psm as set forth in paragraph 2(a) and 2(b), or fails to release the wireless products in accordance with the dates set forth in paragraph 2(b), then fox may terminate this agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period subject to the terms and conditions set forth in paragraph 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. (v) Failure to Obtain Approvals: If Licensee releases a Wireless Product without first obtaining Fox's approval as specifically set forth in this Agreement in Paragraph 9, then Fox may terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period. (vi) other defaults: excepting only those licensee defaults in this paragraph 15 which permit fox to terminate immediately without any cure period for licensee, if either party fails to perform any of its material obligations hereunder, the other party may terminate this agreement upon 30 days' notice, unless the breaching party cures any such breach within said 30 days and gives notice to the other party thereof within that period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that either party (A) fails to pay Royalties or other amounts when due, or (B) fails to make Royalty or other accountings in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, then the breaching party shall be subject to a one-time cure period of fifteen (15) days for such breach. If a party fails to cure the breach within such fifteen (15)-day period or another breach of either (A) or (B) above occurs following an initial cure within the fifteen (15)-day period, then the other party shall have the right in its sole discretion to terminate this Agreement forthwith on written notice without any cure period. (vii) other agreements: should any event of default by licensee cause fox to terminate this agreement fox in its sole discretion may terminate without any cure period any other agreements concurrently existing between fox and licensee upon written notice specifying the agreements to be terminated. For the avoidance of doubt, this remedy shall only apply to any agreements concurrently existing between the specific parties to this Agreement and shall not apply to agreements between Licensee and Fox Sports.

    payment of all royalties, and (ii) at fox's election shall either (a) deliver to fox all materials related to the wireless products or (b) give fox satisfactory evidence of their destruction. Licensee agrees that its failure to stop in all respects the sale and/or distribution of the Wireless Products upon termination or expiration of the Agreement will result in immediate irreparable damage to Fox for which there is no adequate remedy at law, and in the event of such failure by Licensee, Fox shall be entitled to injunctive relief. Fox's exercise of any of the foregoing remedies shall not operate as a waiver of any other rights or remedies which Fox may have. Fox shall not distribute the Wireless Products after the termination or expiration of this Agreement without obtaining from Licensee a separate license to the Licensee Materials. (i) Sell-Off Period: Notwithstanding Paragraph 15(b), in the event of termination of this Agreement, Licensee shall have a period of ***** from the date of such termination (unless such termination occurs less than ***** prior to the expiration of this Agreement in which case the time period shall be shortened accordingly so as not to exceed the date of expiration) in which to sell-off existing inventory of Wireless Products already in the Distribution Channels ("Sell Off Period"). Licensee agrees that no additional Wireless Products may be developed or distributed during the Sell Off Period and Licensee agrees to require that any Licensed CSP to comply with this provision. Upon the expiration of the sell off period licensee agrees to destroy all such remaining inventory and confirm same in writing to fox (and require that any licensed csp do the same). Any revenues credits or other consideration received by licensee for the wireless products during the sell off period will be subject to licensee's obligation to pay fox royalties pursuant to paragraph 7 above. (ii) fox's development of wireless products: in the event of termination or expiration of this agreement or licensee's loss of exclusive rights under this agreement fox shall be free to create and exploit or have a third party create or exploit wireless products which may be similar to those developed and distributed by licensee pursuant to this agreement for the properties. (c) guarantee forfeiture: in the event of termination of this agreement and without limitation of fox's rights and remedies all of which are expressly reserved, the following payment penalties shall apply: (i) if termination occurs in the first year of the term, licensee shall forfeit any guarantee paid, and shall immediately pay any remaining guarantee, up to the amount of ***** dollars (us$*****), and any guarantee payments made in excess of ***** dollars ($*****) shall be refunded by fox to licensee. and (ii) if termination occurs in the second year of the Term, Licensee shall forfeit any Guarantee paid, and shall immediately pay any remaining portion of the Guarantee then unpaid, up to the amount of ***** dollars (US$*****). Any forfeited Guarantees will apply as a set off against any additional damages claimed by Fox. 16. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND PRESS:
