Ladies and Gentlemen:

Blue Hills Bancorp, Inc. (the "Holding Company"), a newly formed Maryland corporation, Hyde Park Bancorp, MHC, a Massachusetts­ chartered mutual holding company (the "MHC"), Hyde Park Bancorp, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (the "Mid­Tier"), and Blue Hills Bank, a Massachusetts­chartered stock savings bank (the "Bank" and together with the Holding Company, the MHC and the Mid­Tier, the "Blue Hills Parties"), hereby confirm their agreement with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (the "agent") as follows:

section 1. The Offering. The MHC, in accordance with the plan of conversion as adopted by the Boards of Directors of each of the Blue Hills Parties (the "Plan"), intends to convert from the current mutual holding company form of organization to a stock holding company form of organization (the "Conversion"). Pursuant to the plan, the holding company will offer and sell up to 24,150,000 shares (subject to increase up to 27,772,500 shares) of its common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the "shares"), in a subscription offering (the "subscription offering") to (1) depositors of the bank with qualifying deposits (as defined in the plan) as of february 28, 2013 ("eligible account holders"), (2) the bank's tax­ qualified employee benefit plans, including the employee stock ownership plan established by the bank (the "esop"), and (3) employees, officers, directors, trustees and corporators of the bank, the mid-tier and the mhc who do not have a higher priority to purchase stock. Subject to the prior subscription rights of the above­listed parties the holding company may offer for sale in a direct community offering (the "community offering" and when referred to together with or subsequent to the subscription offering the "subscription and community offering") the shares not subscribed for or ordered in the subscription offering to members of the general public to whom a copy of the prospectus (as hereinafter defined) is delivered with a preference given first to natural persons and trusts of natural persons residing in the local community as defined in the plan and thereafter to cover orders of other members of the general public. It is anticipated that Shares not subscribed for in the Subscription and Community Offering may be offered to certain members of the general public on a best efforts basis through a selected dealers agreement (the "Syndicated Community Offering") or to certain members of the general public in a firm commitment underwritten offering (the "Underwritten Offering") with the Agent acting as sole book­running manager (the Underwritten Offering, Subscription Offering, Community Offering and Syndicated Community Offering are collectively referred to as the "Offering"). It is acknowledged that the purchase of shares in the offering is subject to the maximum and minimum purchase limitations as described in the plan and that the holding company may reject, in whole or in part, any order received in the community offering or syndicated community offering. The Holding Company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement on Form S-1 (File No. 333­194486) (the "Registration Statement"), containing a prospectus relating to the Subscription and Community Offering, for the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "1933 Act"), and has filed such amendments thereof and such amended prospectuses as may have been required to the date hereof. The term "Registration Statement" shall include all financial schedules and exhibits thereto, as amended, including post-effective amendments. The prospectus, as amended, on file with the Commission at the time the Registration Statement initially became effective is hereinafter called the "Prospectus," except that if any prospectus is filed by the Holding Company pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) of the rules and regulations of the Commission under the 1933 Act (the "1933 Act Regulations") differing from the prospectus on file at the time the Registration Statement initially became effective, the term "Prospectus" shall refer to the prospectus filed pursuant to Rule 424(b) or (c) from and after the time said prospectus is filed with the Commission. In accordance with the massachusetts general laws and the rules and regulations governing the conversion of massachusetts mutual holding companies to stock holding companies (including, without limitation, chapter 167h of the massachusetts general laws and chapter 33, subpart d of the code of massachusetts regulations), as from time to time amended or supplemented (the "massachusetts regulations"), the mhc has filed the plan with the massachusetts division of banks (the "division") and has filed such amendments thereto and supplementary materials as may have been required to the date hereof (such application, as amended to date, if applicable, and as subsequently amended, if applicable, is hereinafter referred to as the "massachusetts conversion application"), including copies of the mhc's notice and information statement for a special meeting of its corporators relating to the conversion (the "information statement"), the appraisal, and the prospectus. Section 2. Retention of Agent; Compensation; Sale and Delivery of the Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions herein set forth, the Blue Hills Parties hereby appoint the Agent as their exclusive financial advisor and conversion agent (i) to utilize its best efforts to solicit subscriptions for Shares and to advise and assist the Holding Company and the Bank with respect to the sale of the Shares in the Offering and (ii) to participate in the Offering in the areas of market making and in syndicate formation or to act as sole book-running manager in the Underwritten Offering (if necessary). The obligations of the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate upon termination of the Offering, but in no event later than 45 days after the completion of the Subscription Offering, unless extended (the "End Date"). All fees or expenses due to the Agent but unpaid will be payable to the Agent in next day funds at the earlier of the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined) or the End Date. In the event the Offering is extended beyond the End Date, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent may agree to renew this Agreement under mutually acceptable terms. In the event the Holding Company is unable to sell a minimum of 17,850,000 Shares within the period herein provided, this Agreement shall terminate and the Holding Company shall refund to any persons who have subscribed for any of the Shares the full amount which it may have received from them plus accrued interest, as set forth in the Prospectus; and none of the parties to this Agreement shall have any obligation to the other parties hereunder, except as set forth in this Section 2 and in Sections 7, 9 and 10 hereof. In the event the Offering is terminated for any reason not attributable to the action or inaction of the Agent, the Agent shall be paid the fees due to the date of such termination pursuant to subparagraphs (a) and (e) below. The agent shall receive the following compensation for its services hereunder:

(e) if as a result of any resolicitation of subscribers undertaken by the holding company the agent reasonably determines that it is required or requested to provide significant services the agent will be entitled to additional compensation for such services which additional compensation will not exceed $50000. Section 3. Sale and Delivery of Shares. If all conditions precedent to the consummation of the Conversion, including without limitation, the sale of all Shares required by the Plan to be sold, are satisfied, the Holding Company agrees to issue, or have issued, the Shares sold in the Offering and to release for delivery certificates for such Shares on the Closing Date against payment to the Holding Company by any means authorized by the Plan; provided, however, that no funds shall be released to the Holding Company until the conditions specified in Section 8 hereof shall have been complied with to the reasonable satisfaction of the Agent or its counsel. The release of Shares against payment therefor shall be made on a date and at a place acceptable to the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent as set forth in Section 14. Certificates for shares shall be delivered directly to the purchasers in accordance with their directions as provided by the Holding Company to the Holding Company's registrar and transfer agent.

(n) At or prior to the Closing Date, counsel to the Agent shall have been furnished with such documents and opinions as they may reasonably require for the purpose of enabling them to pass upon the sale of the Shares as herein contemplated and related proceedings or in order to evidence the occurrence or completeness of any of the representations or warranties, or the fulfillment of any of the conditions, herein contained; and all proceedings taken by the Blue Hills Parties in connection with the sale of the Shares as herein contemplated shall be satisfactory in form and substance to the Agent or its counsel.

but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the blue hills parties or the agent, the blue hills parties and the agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the blue hills parties or the agent from persons other than the other parties thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fees paid to the agent pursuant to section 2 of this agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the holding company from the sale of the shares in the offering, and the blue hills parties shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties' relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Blue Hills Parties and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent's liability is essential to the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this Agreement.
