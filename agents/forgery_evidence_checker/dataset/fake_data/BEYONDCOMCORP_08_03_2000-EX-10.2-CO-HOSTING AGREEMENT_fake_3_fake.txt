NAI appoints Co-Host as a non-exclusive distributor of the      Products to end users ordering the Products from the Destination or the      Co-Host Site, and Co-Host accepts this appointment. Co-Host shall      distribute the Products, as an independent reseller, at its own risk and      expense and subject to any such prices, contractual terms and conditions as      Co-Host may from time to time determine. Nothing in this Agreement shall      prohibit Co-Host from distributing competing products in the Territory. The      "Territory" as that term is used herein shall mean all countries in the      world except countries to which export or re-export of any Product, or the      direct products of any Product is prohibited by United States law without      first obtaining the permission of the United States Office of Export      Administration or its successor.

Any such attempted assignment shall be void and the agreement shall      remain in effect. 2. DISTRIBUTION. Co-Host has the right to market and distribute the Products      subject to the license agreement that accompanies such Product. Co-Host may

       to the advertising materials, the operation of the Destination or the           manufacture, possession, distribution, use or sale of the Goods. Co-host will pay any resulting costs damages and attorneys' fees           finally awarded by a court or agreed to in settlement by co-host           with respect to any such claims. Nai agrees that, if the advertising           materials become, or in co-host's opinion are likely to become, the           subject of an infringement claim, nai will permit co-host, at           co-host's option and expense, to, among other things, procure the           right for nai to continue marketing and using the advertising           materials, or to replace or modify them so that they become           non-infringing. 7    8

Co-host may, during the term of this agreement,           obtain a credit for the price paid by co-host to be applied against           current or future invoices, for all versions of products shipped by           nai within the previous ninety (90) days that nai discontinues or           which are removed from nai's current retail price list. Such credit           will be equal to the price paid by co-host for such obsolete products,           less discounts received under section 5 of this agreements. All such           discontinued products will be counted and inspected at the inspection           site by nai's employee and upon nai's acceptance thereof (which will           be a condition of co-host's eligibility for a credit hereunder) such           products will be promptly and completely destroyed or if requested by           nai such products or any portion thereof will be returned to nai as           it directs. No Product shall be deemed discontinued if a later version           of the Product is still being offered by NAI and end users may obtain           the current version of such Product from NAI electronically at no           additional charge. (d)  Freight. Co-Host will pay all costs (including freight) associated           with the return of the Products to NAI and back to Co-Host as provided           herein, except that NAI will be responsible for all freight costs           associated with (i) the return of Products under Section 7(b), (ii)           the return of any discontinued or obsolete Products under Section           7(c), and (iii) the return of other Product updates agreed upon by NAI           and Co-Host. 8.

The Effective Date of this Agreement (herein called the "Effective Date") is September 21, 1998. RECITALS

  PROGRAM:                                                   FUNDING:

       (ii) all additional orders following such thirty (30) day period will                be shipped at the new price; (iv) orders for such product in nai's order entry system in excess of                the quantity specified in (iii) above will be shipped at the new                price unless they are canceled by co-host by written notice to                nai, provided that such notice is received by nai no later than                fifteen (15) days prior to the date of shipment specified in such                order. (d)  Price Decrease. If NAI decreases its suggested retail price for any           Product (a product upgrade with a different part number will not be           the same Product), the decrease will apply to all units of such           Product in Co-Host's inventory and orders in transit to Co-Host from           NAI that are in an unopened, salable condition as of the effective           date of the decrease, provided that such Products had been shipped to           Co-Host no more than ninety (90) days prior to such effective date. To           be eligible for such price protection, Co-Host must deliver to NAI           written evidence, signed by Co-Host, of an inventory of such Products           showing the number and location of each unit of Product for which           Co-Host claims price protection eligibility hereunder within thirty           (30) days of receiving notice of such price decreases. Such reduction           will constitute a credit on Co-Host's account for future orders from           NAI under this Agreement (unless the Agreement has terminated or           expired in which case such reduction will be refunded to the extent           that Co-Host does not owe NAI money) in an amount equal to the           difference between the net invoice price at which each such unit in           inventory was provided to Co-Host and the current price then           applicable for shipments of such Product to Co-Host hereunder. (e)  TAXES. (i)  All amounts payable by Co-Host to NAI under this Agreement are                exclusive of any tax, withholding tax, levy, or similar                governmental charge that may be assessed by any jurisdiction in                or outside the Territory except income and similar taxes levied                on and payable by NAI. Such taxes, withholding taxes, levies, and                governmental charges (collectively "Taxes") include Taxes based                on sales, use, excise, import or export values/fees, value-added,                income, revenue, net worth, or may be the result of the delivery,                possession, or use of the Products, the execution or performance                of this Agreement or otherwise. Should any Taxes be due, Co-Host                agrees to pay such Taxes and indemnify NAI for any claim for

  (b)  quarterly payments of $312,500 each, with the first payment being due           september 15, 1999, and on each december 15, march 15, june 15, and           september 15 thereafter during the term unless (i) the agreement is           terminated in accordance with section 6 of the agreement prior to such           date in which case no quarterly payments will be due following the           effective date of such termination or (ii) if the minimum revenue           target (as defined in part 2 of this exhibit "a") for the first year           of the term is not achieved by the first anniversary of the effective           date, in which case no quarterly payments are payable until such time           as the minimum revenue target for the first year of the term is           achieved at which point co-host will resume making future quarterly           payments on the schedule and in the amount set forth above for the           duration of the term or (iii) if the aggregate minimum revenue targets           (as defined in part 2 of this exhibit "a") for the first and second           year of the term are not achieved by the second anniversary of the           effective date, then, even if the minimum revenue target (as defined           in part 2 of this exhibit "a") for the first year of the term has been           achieved prior to such second anniversary, no quarterly payments are           payable during the second year of the term until such time as such           aggregate minimum revenue target is achieved at which point co-host           will resume making future quarterly payments on the schedule and in           the amount set forth above for the duration of the term. The parties           hereby agree to renegotiate in good faith a downward adjustment to the           foregoing quarterly payments in the event that the Minimum Revenue           Target for year one (1) is not achieved in the first year of this           Agreement. 12    13

In addition, in the event that any hot links to the McAfee Mall are located on any web page on the Originating Locations other than on the Online Service Page, then a hot link to the Co-Host Site shall all be located on such web page and shall be no less prominent (whether is size, location or format) than any hot link to the McAfee Mall. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the hot links to the Co-Host Site referred to above shall be no less prominent (whether in size, location or format) than any third party hot link on the Online Service Page or the Originating Locations. 13    14

                     terms and conditions of agreement

  (a)  Co-Hosting Rights. Co-host shall be permitted to maintain on the           online service page (as defined in part 2 of exhibit "a") of the           originating locations in the manner set forth on exhibit "b" hereto           (and on such other positions as are set forth on exhibit "b" or as the           parties may mutually agree upon in writing from time to time) a hot           link to internet locations specified by the co-host (the           "destination") from which goods (other than competitor's goods           (hereinafter defined)) may be sold. The web pages at the destination           shall be maintained in accordance with the requirements of this           agreement including without limitation section 2 hereof. "Competitor's Goods" as used herein shall mean the Goods of any of the           persons or entities described on Part 1 of Exhibit "C" attached hereto           and made a part hereof. The Destination shall not contain any links to           any third party sites for the purchase of Competitor's Goods; provided           that the Destination will link to the Co-Host Site (which will sell           Competitor's Goods). (b)  Exclusive Positioning. Co-Host shall be the exclusive reseller of           software products ("Software") at the Originating Locations. The           preceding sentence shall not prohibit NAI from (i) reselling Software           including NAI Goods (hereinafter defined) from the McAfee Mall; (ii)           referencing and linking to sites of strategic partners (other than           competitors of Co-Host listed on Part 2 of Exhibit "C") which may also           be involved in the resale of Software from such sites; Provided that           no software may be purchased on the page of such site which is linked           to any originating location and further provided that the references           and links to the sites of strategic partners shall not be placed on           the online service page; And (iii) advertising software with banners,           buttons and other forms of online advertising; Provided that any link           from such advertising takes the end user to the publisher of the           software and not a reseller of goods (other than co-host). For           example, an advertising banner or button for the Windows 98 software           program may link back to the website of Microsoft Corporation but not           the website of Dell Computer Corporation which is reselling the           program. Without limitation on the foregoing, NAI may co-host a           comparative shopping service on the Originating Locations. NAI will           obtain a written covenant that the comparative shopping co-host will           present sellers of Software in a neutral manner and upon request of           Co-Host will require removal or alteration of presentations by such           co-host on such co-hosted facility which Co-Host reasonably deems to           be non-neutral; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the           foregoing, Co-Host may be the featured or most prominent Software           reseller on any such service. (c)  Short Term Product Exclusives. For a period of fourteen (14) days           following release of any new NAI Goods or major version releases           (i.e., version 3.0 to 4.0) of existing NAI Goods, Co-Host shall be the           exclusive online seller of any such

       Agreement. (b)  Advertising Materials; Destination operation. Co-host shall provide to           nai artwork and text materials with respect to the advertisement of           the destination at the originating locations. Such artwork and           materials must be non-infringing, inoffensive, accurate, truthful and           otherwise comply with all applicable laws. Co-host shall comply with           all applicable laws in connection with the operation of the           destination including without limitation requirements regarding the           confidentiality of information concerning end users. Nai retains the           right, but not the obligation, to disapprove or remove any           advertisements or advertising materials it reasonably deems illegal,           inappropriate or otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the           originating sites, without the consent of co-host. (c)  Use of Trademarks. Co-Host hereby grants to NAI a non-exclusive,           non-transferable, royalty-free license during the term of this           Agreement to use the trademarks, service marks and trade names of           Co-Host in connection with the advertising and promotion of the Goods           from the Originating Locations, provided that NAI complies with the           terms of Section 9(b) of the Web Site Services Agreement (as defined           below). Co-Host reserves the right to terminate the foregoing right,           after giving NAI notice and opportunity to cure the allegedly harmful           use, if in Co-Host's reasonable judgment, NAI's use of such           trademarks, service marks and trade names harms the business, image or           goodwill of Co-Host. 4    5

(c)  effect of termination. Upon the effective date of the termination all           outstanding invoices and other invoicable amounts will become due and           payable. Co-Host's contractual right to the marketing consideration           shall cease immediately upon the effective date of the termination. Termination or expiration of this Agreement if by reason of material           breach by Co-Host shall not affect any of Co-Host's payment           obligations, all of which survive termination of this Agreement; provided that, in (i) the event of termination of this Agreement by           Co-Host due to a material default by NAI, NAI shall pay to the Co-Host           the Liquidated Damages Amount (as defined in Part 2 of Exhibit "A"). 7. CONFIDENTIALITY. Confidential information disclosed by either party in      writing and marked as "confidential," proprietary" or the like (or      disclosed verbally if a written summary is provided within thirty days),      including any information relating to such party's research, development,      proprietary technology, product and marketing plans, finances, personnel      and business opportunities will be considered confidential information. Each party will not use the other party's confidential information except      as required to achieve the objectives of this Agreement and will not      disclose such confidential information except to employees, agents and      contractors who have a need to know in the discharge of their duties under      this Agreement. Such restrictions will not apply to information that      becomes public knowledge other than through the disclosing party, is      independently developed by the non-disclosing party, or is lawfully      required to be disclosed by any governmental agency or otherwise required      to be disclosed by law. 6    7

  (b)  Co-Host acknowledges that some NAI Products hereto contain encryption           and some are export restricted (the "Restricted Software") by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Export Administration (BXA). Co-Host further acknowledges that for this reason, the export of such           items may subject the Co-Host or its executives to fines and/or other           severe penalties. Unless all required permits and/or approvals have           been obtained, co-host shall not export or re-export the restricted           software outside of the united states, whether directly or indirectly,           and will not cause, approve or otherwise facilitate others such as           agents, subsequent purchasers, licensees or any other third parties in           doing so. The parties agree to cooperate with each other with respect           to any application for any required licenses and approvals. However,           Co-Host acknowledges it is their ultimate responsibility to comply           with all export laws with respect to the Restricted Software and that           NAI has no further responsibility after the initial sale to the           Co-Host within the United States. 8    23
